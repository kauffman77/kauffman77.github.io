<i>The above table was updated on 20-May-2024 to reflect the table in
  the syllabus which includes the A+ and D+/D- cutoffs.</i>

<h2>Project Makeup Credit</h2>
<p> Some projects featured MAKEUP CREDIT which needs to be applied
  manually.  If you lost points on one project but had makeup credit
  on another, manually redistribute credit. Example: P1 was 93 / 100,
  P2 was 110 / 100; enter P1: 100, P2: 100. </p>

<h2>HW Grade Scoring</h2>
<p> For HW grades, enter the total points up to 110 (best 11 / 13
  HWs). Most HW quizzes are worth 10 points. Drop the lowest 2 scores
  and total the remaining HW scores.
  <!-- <i>Note: Originally the calculator indicated there were 14 HWs but -->
  <!-- only 13 were offered. </i> -->
</p>

<h2>Engagement Points</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Labs are worth 1 Engagement Point per completion. The total
    possible exercises is listed below. Partial credit may be assigned
    for some labs which should be added to the total completed. Some
    labs involve completing a Survey rather than code/quizzes.
    <ul>
      <li> 12 "Normal" Labs (including Dis09: Assembly Reflection)</li>
      <li> 1 Midterm Survey (associated with Lab04)</li>
      <li> 1 Exit Survey on Canvas (associated with Lab14)</li>
      <li> Total: 14 Labs / Surveys</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  

  <li> Bonus Engagement Points can be earned through other means such
    participation in lecture and the discussion board. Canvas will list a
    "Bonus Engagement Points" column with totals for these after the
    end of of the semester.
  </li>
  <li> Project Late Days: Engagement points are deducted for each day
    late a project is submitted.  Canvas will list a "Project Late Days"
    column which should be subtracted from the total Engagement Points.
  </li>
  <li> <i>Computed Engagement Points = Labs + Bonus - Late.</i> <br/>Full
    credit is earned by obtaining 10 Engagement Points for 10%. Each
    point beyond this earns 0.25% in Bonus Credit.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
