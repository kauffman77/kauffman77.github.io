Regarding the lecture videos, I think they were a nice feature but I
could rarely find the video for the 11AM lecture, only the 9:30AM
lecture.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Both lectures generally covered about the same thing so I only
posted one video, whichever I thought went better. If you want to
see what happens in your lecture, come to lecture.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
Lectures are long.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Alternate take: your attention is too short.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
Kauffman needs to&#x2026; not answer as many questions as I find it
difficult to follow along sometimes, which causes me to lose
interest.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If the questions that others have cause you to lose interest, that's a
bad sign.  Focus on what they are asking and learn from it.  Your
generation has the reputation for poor attention spans. Surpass that
characterization by improving your capacity to focus.
</p>

<div id="orge5bba34" class="figure">
<p><img src="quotes_on_focus.jpg" alt="quotes_on_focus.jpg" style="max-width:100%;" />
</p>
</div>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
I think Professor Kauffman should try to minimize the use of overly
elevated vocabulary words during lecture.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Inconceivable.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li>I think the quality of the videos could be better since the mic
would cut off or become incomprehensible at least once per video.</li>
<li><p>
The static in the video recordings that happen every once in a while
genuinely just hurt my brain to listen to&#x2026; I'm surprised if it
hasn't been brought up by anyone else yet and honestly that's my
biggest complaint about this course.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In the last weeks of the semester I started noticing microphone
malfunctions during lecture. A large number of students mentioned in
this feedback that this extended to static, popping, and cutouts as
well. I don't re-watch lecture videos, just post them, so I was not
aware how bad the problem is. My $30 Amazon mic seems to have reached
is end-of-life and I'll get a new one. I'm sorry that I did not hear
about this earlier as I would have taken faster measures to fix
things. Thanks to all who notified me in feedback about the issues.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
One thing that was slightly frustrating for me especially towards
the end of the course was that because the project overview videos
were posted on Youtube there was constant advertisements. I counted
that I had to watch almost 5 ad's in a ten minute timeframe which
was pretty annoying when I had limited time to watch the videos and
I was constantly being interrupted by advertisements. If possible it
would be helpful if the videos could just be posted on Panopto like
the lab walkthroughs and the lectures.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Gone are the good old days when if you didn't "monetize" videos on
Youtube, no ads would play on them. I was not aware that this had
changed and was a source of frustration. Likely I'll follow your
suggestion and post project videos on Canvas instead as ads do nothing
for students nor me and merely pad the pockets of Google. Thanks for
notifying me about this frustration.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
Please post lecture videos earlier, I didn't watch them often but
there was a time I couldn't make it and was kind of annoying to have
to wait until the next day since I went to discussion not knowing
what they were talking about.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I find it annoying to post videos at all. It's more work and many of
my peers have observed that it "enables" folks to just skip class
even though they've made a commitment through enrollment to
attend. I do it because many students express that it provides help
for them. Be cautious when launching complaints like the above; with
enough such complaints, folks like myself may seek to reduce the
complaints about the timeliness of videos by just NOT posting
videos.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li>I have never had lectures be such well-paced&#x2026;  I also enjoyed how
we could get bonus points for asking questions and how Professor
Kauffman responded to my doubts.</li>
<li>Lectures are alright however they include a lot of bloat can be from
the excess questions people ask which made it hard to focus on what
was actually being taught.</li>
<li>I think a lot of kids asking questions in lecture was not that
helpful because I would zone out&#x2026;  I feel like if kids have
questions, they should save them for the end of the lecture.</li>
<li>I think participating in class should be mandatory to a certain
extent. Maybe, raise your hands 3 times throughout the semester for
credit, and any additional times after is a bonus.</li>
<li>In a massive lecture room, there are only so many times you get
lucky enough to answer a question</li>
<li>I felt bad asking questions since it would slow the lecture down a
lot.</li>
<li>You probably don't believe me but I promise at least half of the
questions asked are from people pretending not to know something
just to get participation credit.</li>
<li><p>
I also love how Prof. Kauffman makes the class an environment where
I don't feel judged asking questions if I don't understand
something&#x2026; engagement points are an incentive to participate, but
the vibe of the classroom is much more supporting of us shy-folk and
makes it much much easier to do so.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Like any policy significant decision, my choice to incentivize
conversation in class has tradeoffs. I've set the policy as it is
because the goals I wish to accomplish are facilitated by policy:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Barriers to inquire more deeply through questions are low.</li>
<li>If a point of confusion arises, someone will ask and that will
benefit everyone with greater clarity.</li>
<li>Our time together is not a broadcast by one but a dialogue among
many as befits an in-person meeting at the academy.</li>
</ul>
<p>
These aspects might rankle some as they feel a "lecture" should be one
person talking and others simply listening without interruption. Those
folks are entitled to their opinions and are free to skip lecture and
read the textbook which offers such an experience or perhaps watch
recordings of me or someone else and skip the parts they wish.  Those
folks wish to learn on their own. As for me, learning together is a
richer experience that teaches not only technical content but patience
and appreciation for alternate perspectives. I encourage students to
consider this part of their academic experience the next time they are
perturbed by someone else's question: where will you learn to listen
to others and hear them out if not in places like our meetings?
</p>

<p>
Like any policy system, there are benefits and costs to awarding
in-class participation.  According to the self-reporting of students
in this anonymous survey, about 33% of students ask questions in
lecture due to being curious and about 11% indicate they ask solely
for to earn participation credit.  That means about 1 in 4 questions
is purely points motivated.  I am fine with that ratio just as I am
fine with the taxes I pay funding many things I like and some I
don't. As has been said, "I like to pay taxes. With them, I buy
civilization." (Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.); or in our case, <i>I like
questions. With them we buy understanding.</i>

My only complaint is that if you don't sit near the front center
row, it's harder to get called on for a question.

Following what Prof K says [in lecture] is like trying to hold on to
barreling train&#x2026;.  It feels sort of like during lecture you're
just holding on to hearing the words (the train) and rewatching
you're like oh there was a mountain, we crossed a bridge etc.

[P4] being assigned after finishing up assembly and a long break
between projects also made it more difficult as I found I had
forgotten how to code in C.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Forgetting makes everything harder. Hopefully the project helped jog
your memory.

<li><p>
Make the projects more like the puzzlebin projects. Make it more
like a puzzle which the student must figure out how to solve using
the tools they know, rather than just reading a predetermined
specification and trying to follow it as closely as possible.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The "puzzle" projects appeal to some but are actually not reflective
of the norm for creating software.  The two places I employ them have
specific goals that align well with the style: basic debugger
discipline, learning about features of assembly, and examining
binaries.  Other skills in the course require coding, not analysis, so are
inappropriate to this style of assignment. If you are looking for more
puzzles to build skills, you might <a href="https://github.com/kauffman77/shellslayer">try this</a>.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li>I learned so, so much from the projects, but they were also so, so
time-consuming. I generally used almost all of the time allowed for
projects, working several hours each day, and submitted 1-2 days
before the deadline. It was stressful completing the projects and
then realizing I had minimal time left for my remaining classes.</li>
<li><p>
Most of my studying was done by legitimately doing the projects
though so I guess it saved me time.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The intent was for projects to take time and teach. Glad that this
appeared to be the case for most students. Learning to play an
instrument, paint a portrait, climb a rock wall, or deliver a
convincing speech takes time and diligent practice. Much of the
world wonders out the ability of programmers to construct
programs. When they wonder at your skill, you can relate the many
hours you spent to hone your craft just as any artist, athlete, or
leader does.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
I would like to complain about project 4 which had its due date on
Saturday rather than on Monday/Tuesday like all the other projects
since it meant I didn't have the weekend to finish the project.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Sorry this didn't work for you. In cases where we could, we tried to
peg deadlines to dates that would allow students to get last-minute
help in discussion sections. As was observed by many students, the
timing for P4 was bad and we'll avoid this trap in the future.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
I felt that the projects were not very interesting. I think if the
projects were designed around a real world problem and using
computer systems to solve it would have made for more interesting
work that has more applicability.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We built (1) a search algorithm, (2) an embedded display construction,
(3) an interactive data structure program, (3) a small shell
implementation, (4) an optimized data analysis routine, and (5) an
implementation of a heap.  I'm sorry if you found these uninteresting
but your characterization of them as not "real world problems" is
badly misguided. Please reflect on the nature of the projects more to
understand where you are wrong.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
In 132 I was able to finish most projects in a day I wouldn't say
that they were easy but I definitely found myself able to enter a
flow state when working on those projects as opposed to these. With
these projects if I started a day or two after they were assigned I
could definitely finish them in a more relaxed manner however, it
would definitely be a multi day process.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
While there is variation, as you mature, problems are not such that
you can solve them in a single sitting. This requires you to develop
skills to come into and out of a project over many sittings.  That
will be the norm as your academic and professional career advances. It
seems you got some practice at that in this course which is
great. Keep building those skills: how does one get quickly into the
flow state, tune out distractions, and leave work in a state that is
easy to pick up tomorrow. Programs are not static: they grow and
evolve and tending them is our business.

However after completing the project, I actually felt very
accomplished.

Project 3 was likely the MOST frustrating and maddening thing I have
ever done in my life&#x2026; like trying to catch a leviathan with a
fishing net, like fighting a kraken with a paddleboard, like sailing
through a hurricane on a lifeboat. I write all this to tell you:

I wish that late projects would cost EITHER engagement points or a
certain number of extra project points.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I'll consider it but the decision to separate late penalties into a
separate category is intentional. It allows those penalties be offset
by other means than performance on the coding projects.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
I feel like the function descriptions of the last few projects have
become more ambiguous. At the start, it was crystal clear as to how
to implement something, almost to a fault, because I didn't feel
like I was thinking sometimes. However, especially on project four,
the descriptions were more confusing, and I often had to reread them
to understand a simple concept.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Project 4 was more complex that earlier projects. It is hard to
distinguish whether the ambiguity you sense is due to problems with
the descriptions or instead a lack of familiarity with how to employ
course techniques in the project context. I'll review the function
descriptions on P4 and make adjustments where it seems
appropriate. However, my intention over the semester is to move from
prescriptive function outline (almost everything dictated) to
descriptions of outcomes that leave students to explore how to
accomplish the outcome themselves. This is part of maturing:
connecting the "what" to the "how" yourself. Some amount of
experimentation is expected in those settings.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
I feel like my effort on the projects far exceeded that which went
into the labs and homework quizzes. Both are worth 20% of our grade
(projects vs. HW/lab combined).
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
As one of my past instructor observed, "Some points are easy to get,
some are harder." That's by design. If you want them all, you'll need
to commit.

We are in a details oriented field but accumulating all those details

<li><p>
I do think that studying for exams are hard due to the lack of
materials&#x2026; I completely acknowledge that this is because I've been
spoiled by Larry [Herman]'s 20 page practice exams.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I'm glad that you disclosed that a past instructor provided such a
large repository of practice. This helps me to understand student
expectations better. As you indicated, providing such a large bank of
practice questions is unusual. Before I came to UMD, I saw very few
instructors provide past exams as preparatory material as writing exam
problems that do a good job in evaluating understanding is quite
difficult.  I'll consider making changes but the following makes me
reluctant to do so: every student who has approached me about wanting
more practice problems has not been able to show me answers they wrote
themselves for HW problems.  They all just clicked through the online
quizzes to get credit. At the point a large fraction of students come
to me with their own answers to all of the practice materials that
I've already provided and want more, I'd consider it more
seriously. My perception is that what students want is more exam
questions that they can memorize answers to and regurgitate on the
upcoming exam. That's not the kind of learning I'm interested in
encouraging so I don't feel a compulsion to provide additional
practice materials.  As Thelonius Monk responded once to the question
of why he hadn't written more songs, "Why write new tunes? They
haven't figured out the old ones yet."
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
The fact that I had to use my brain so much makes the projects the
main contributing factor to my success on exams.

A third exam would have been amazing.

I used to do so but the scheduling is so tight already it's hard. If

consider doing a 3rd exam but not as is with the 2-lectures per week.

After discussing with the staff, we have some ideas for next semester

I think it'd be nice if the lab questions could tell you either a)
what questions you got wrong or b) how many you got
wrong. There's no distinction between getting one wrong or all
of them wrong.

<p>
That is an intentional measure to make the labs more challenging.
While it can be frustrating, ask for help or brute force it if needed.
Developing confidence in your answers is essential. HWs are where
things are intentionally easy but Labs are more than that.

<li><p>
I wish discussion had more worksheets to mimic written questions to
help practice for exams.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We will consider this but you should consider the ramifications for
such a decision: attendance to lab now becomes required to earn
credit. That means a policy for missing labs, grading work for the
worksheets, makeup possibilities for being ill, etc.  It's a
significant change and the benefit is not overly clear when HW already
provides a spot you can practice writing answers if you want.

I'll review the HW but last time I checked, it aligns pretty well with
exam-style questions. That is my intent when I write exams ans HWs.

I think the discussions could go over test like practice problems
related to lecture instead of the lab to help better prepare

Several pre-exam discussions had review exercises with exactly this

I do think discussion, at times, could benefit from being online. I
know a few commuter students who had to miss discussion on a few

helpful.

recorded and posted and so on. If you want a truly online experience,
find an online program in which to enroll. This is not that.

I was (and still am a bit) confused about the difference between
engagement and bonus engagement points, if any.  Some more detailed
description on how these points interact with late project
submissions would have been great.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Perhaps <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~profk/216/syllabus.html#engagement-points">this will help</a>. It's been available to read since the
beginning of the course.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
One of the things I noticed with the Piazza posts/engagement points
was that some students would take advantage of the bonus points and
accumulate 50+ responses, one student going as high as 250+. This
takes away the opportunity for other students to get engagement
points on Piazza, especially those who cannot respond immediately
when a post is made. I believe there should be a cap, perhaps at
20-25 responses, so other students can have the opportunity to
respond and earn an engagement point. Another possible solution
could be to apply a maximum number of responses per day, perhaps 2-3
responses maximum.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I understand the sentiment and the potential benefit from
"rate-limiting" participation, Piazza does not have the technical
capability to rate limit posts. If it did, I'd probably rate limit
Question posting in some fashion first before answer-posting. This
might encourage students to try harder to post meaningful questions
and cut down somewhat on "here's my broken code, what's wrong with
it?" type questions. These take a lot of back and forth of "show us
the error messages" and "what was the test doing" and "what have you
tried so far" and so on. Rate limiting might cause students to learn
more quickly to include such details at the get go. However, we don't
have any rate limiting capabilities and this is an education community
anyway so I'd be loathe limit any questioner or those that are helping
to provide answers.
</p>

<p>
The reward for answering Piazza posts is based on a log2() scale.
Answering 15 Piazza posts gets 4 bonus EPs, answering 16 more for 31
total gets 1 more bonus EP.  This is diminishing returns by
definition. While there may be a few folks that are motivated purely
by the bonus, I'm betting on such 'profit' motives as waning after the
returns get small. Rather, many past students who were superstars on
Piazza did so because they cared. Some of them are now TAs. I'd
hesitate to do anything to diminish that pipeline. Nothing is
stopping you from posting Notes about techniques you thought were
helpful to know and then getting a "good note" endorsement from
instructors that earns the same as an answer.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
Some students definitely mark dots after lectures when they didn't
participate or mark an extra dot when they did.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Several students wrote to me asking "why don't I have any dots? I know
I marked them?" Those students got 0 dots because they had clearly
marked more than was numerically possible in given time periods.
While I'm sure the honor system didn't prevent everyone from getting
exactly what they earned, egregious breaches were detected and got
nothing.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
I notice some students seem to mass reply to everything [on Piazza]
as fast as possible, even when they don't actually know an answer in
what seems to be some attempt at farming engagement points.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I agree that the quality of some student answers is lower than what
I'd like. To boot, some students have taken to making minor edits to
answers in an effort to get some credit.  I'll thank about how this
might be handled to preserve the community while limiting the
gamesmanship. 
</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Please remove the engagement point bonuses on participation and
answering piazza posts&#x2026;  Please stop the in class participation
credit too, 50% of the class is someone asking useless questions for
engagement points.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
According to the self-reported numbers show above on in-class
questions, about 33% of students indicated they asked questions due to
pure curiosity with abut 11% indicating they asked questions purely to
earn bonuses.  An additional 5% indicate they started purely motivated
by the bonuses but became curious over time.  If you believe in your
peers honesty, then you are wrong on the motivation front: the
majority of questions are asked to further the understanding of the
asker.
</p>

<p>
As for the "useless questions" I keep mental track of what I think
of as useless and not. Rarely does a useless question arise.
Sometimes I have to repeat myself but that is part of
education. Sometimes questions lead to tangents but often these are
incredibly interesting areas to explore and enrich our discussion.
I cannot say for certain what is useful or not for you but I'm
suspicious of such blanket assertions especially when I find
dialogue inspired by questions to be so useful for the class as a
whole.  If you want there to be better questions, ask some
yourself. The academy / university is a place where people come
together to learn from one another through dialogue. If that's
frustrating for you, find a different environment in which to
learn. In addition to the technical content of a major, academic
work should teach you patience and respect for your peers and their
ideas. That is an essential part of living in a society that allows
for free inquiry.
</p>

<p>
I'm comforted by the fact that 89% of students reported liking
the engagement points scheme as it is right now. We are not likely
to ditch the EP system, just continue to refine it.

On P4&#x2026; if I ran make update right before I tested, my code would
pass, and I would have to run make update before I run any test as
it would somehow reset after every time I updated my code.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
P4 involved systems programming which is pretty stateful: behavior
changes based on whether files/directories exist, time is a factor,
system load changes the outcome, and so on.  I expect that your code
modified something in the testing files and that caused the first runs
to be fine but the change caused subsequent runs to fail. The <code>make
  update</code> would restore the testing files and allow for passing again.
P4 tests are among the hardest to write. Try writing some for yourself
at some point and you'll get the idea.  Then have 300+ students write
buggy code and see if your tests hold up. I'm always surprised that
the tests for this project work at all. I'll keep refining them to
try to catch cases like those you describe but it's always going to be
a losing battle.

Teach us how to set up WSL or install the programs natively on mac,
I don't want to use that goofy grace server
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Picking an environment in which you can code from this class is hard.
It's a computer systems class. That means to get the same behavior for
all students, they need the same computer system.  The easiest way to
arrange that in the past is for students to log into the same computer
system, GRACE in our case. It has some drawbacks and I'd like
something better, but it adopts one set of problems so as to avoid the
myriad problems that are present in having students run natively.
</p>

<p>
GRACE may be goofy, but so is your machine. You're still on WSL v1 and
don't know it so the setup process we provide didn't work. Then
there's your classmate that's still running Windows 10 so has a
different WSL setup and bugs that come with it. Never mind your
classmates with old Macs which can't install GCC and its ilk except
through unofficial 3rd party package managers like Homebrew. Never mind
the folks that don't bother with this, type <code>gcc</code> and say "see, it's
installed" not realizing that the brilliant folks at Apple changed
over to using CLang a decade ago but just symlinked the command <code>gcc</code>
to a different compiler. And then there are your classmates that have
newer ARM-based Macs that we can't have code Intel assembly as it
won't run natively on their machines. "It has an emulator" you might
say and you'd be right but it doesn't allow you to debug code
(e.g. GDB won't work through the emulator) which makes it a hell of
a lot harder for those folks.  Would you like to code P3 without being
able to use GDB to look at what your code is doing?
</p>

<p>
I appreciate your desire to want to set up a different environment
that is more convenient for you. Please always seek to do so. Figure
out ways to make your workflow better.  Those of us administering the
course have a different problem: how do we create an environment that
is fairly uniform and accessible to all students? It's almost
impossible to give every student individual attention to set up,
configure, and administer their own environment on their own
machine in a way that leads to predictable behavior on coursework. The
effort we put into trying this is effort that can't be spent on the
actual course content. 
</p>

<p>
I've spent considerable time exploring alternatives and arrived at the
use of remote servers as the quickest, easiest way to get a uniform
environment for students. I'd like to reconfigure GRACE and have some
leads on how, but I disagree that local environments for students is
tractable.  Logging in to remote machines also teaches students how to
access a remote machine and get work done there. You'll be doing that
in many later courses and throughout your entire computing career. And
most of the servers you access will be goofy in one way or another so
get used to that part too.

Project 4 was the only thing I found hard in the class, because it
took me a while to realize that using a shared folder in a virtual
machine was screwing me over, I moved my project to a different
folder and all the sudden it worked!!
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Indeed: a shared folder between a virtual machine and the Native OS
will likely have mixed conventions for the file system and permissions
which will not go great. Glad you sorted this out: that's good
knowledge to have as you go ahead as VMs and Containers abound these
days. This is one of the reasons we are leery to have students use
native solutions rather than GRACE: bugs are subtle and individual
the student setup which makes it really hard for staff to debug.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li>[On P4] I was passing 49/50 tests on Grace, the auto-grader failed
all of the tests&#x2026; I figured out my file permissions were written
wrong and I got it to work.</li>
<li><p>
There isn't anything seriously wrong with Grace, as far as I am
concerned.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The only "serious" problem I see is it's awkward <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_File_System">Andrew File System</a>
which does not obey the standard UNIX file <code>rwx</code> permissions
conventions which makes projects like P4 harder to manage. We'll
likely have fixes for that stuff in not-to-distant future.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li>The only thing I found annoying was repeatedly putting in my
password and verifying duo push whenever I logged into grace or vs
code, but there's nothing you guys can really do about that.</li>
<li><p>
This is somewhat minor, but I would occasionally be dissuaded from
working on labs/projects because of the overhead from logging into
Grace. It truly only takes 15 seconds, but there were instances in
which I had 10 or so minutes of free time to work, but chose not to
because I'd have to log into Grace.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The login process is an irritating gumption trap that saps the will
to work from everyone. It is an irritation I'm working to smooth. I
have some evidence that we might be able to get a reconfiguration so
that students don't have as much tedium in terms of logging in. At
my past universities, login could be done using SSH Keys
(public/private pair) which allowed password-free login and in some
cases also spared the need to do Duo/2FA checks.  I'll be working
with admins this summer to see if we can set that up for servers
used in 216 to spare students this bit of friction. In most
industrial settings, if you are frequently logging into a server,
you'll have such options available so it makes sense to teach about
that here too.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
My friend told me the trick to manually join less busy servers like
grace 7 or 9, if I didn't know that trick, I definitely wouldn't
have submitted some of the projects on time (especially project 4).
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
That was a "trick" we pinned on Piazza during P5 as it became
necessary to get onto certain "well-behaved" nodes.  I regret not
discovering the changes the admins made to GRACE prior to those
projects but based on the overall good results students had on the
projects, I think we managed alright.  Keep such tricks up your sleeve
as they are likely to come in handy down the line.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
I thought the projects were extremely helpful but I had major issues
with tests passing in Grace but not passing in Gradescope.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
That again is a pain point as I'd like tooling
(compiler/Valgrind/library versions) to align between Gradescope and
GRACE (or whatever server we use for the course). Aligning these will
mean that student get more reliable results which everyone
appreciates, especially those of us having to debug problems like the
one your reported.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
I had a small pet peeve in this course that during the projects the
description for the code was always pasted below the method as
opposed to it being above (exception being P5), but I always ended
up copying and pasting the method specs to be above the method.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I vacillate between above/below for the documentation comments.  It
makes sense to me in a function listing to show the function prototype
first and then a description of what it does like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-c">  int compute_special(int a, int b);
  // Computes an important value based on a and b. When a and b are
  // incompatible this function always returns 0.
  
  double **outer_prod(double *vec1, int len1, double *vec2, int len2);
  // Computes the outer produce of the two vectors. Returns a matrix of
  // dimension len1 * len2 with its memory allocated on the heap.
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This allows the description to reference the arguments in the
prototype. However, when I'd fill in the body of the function, I'd
like the doc comment above the prototype like:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-c">  // Computes an important value based on a and b. When a and b are
  // incompatible this function always returns 0.
  int compute_special(int a, int b){
    ...;
    ...;
    ...;
    ...;
  }
  
  // Computes the outer produce of the two vectors. Returns a matrix of
  // dimension len1 * len2 with its memory allocated on the heap.
  double **outer_prod(double *vec1, int len1, double *vec2, int len2){
    ...;
    ...;
    ...;
    ...;
  }
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I use script to convert the solution in the 2nd form with its doc
comments into the 1st outline form for students to read.
</p>

<p>
It's largely a matter of taste and you certainly weren't required to
place the doc comments anywhere in particular in your own code.
That's part of maturing: you get to see different styles, develop your
own, and argue endlessly with others about subjective things like the
"right style".

<li><p>
I got a really "funny" error on Project 5 with a negative 0. I fixed
it but the sight was so utterly terrifying it nearly killed my will

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I helped a few folks debug this kind of thing and it's one of the
reasons that floating point computations are harder to test: they are
finicky and have quirks like <code>+0.0</code> AND <code>-0.0</code>.  You can check our
textbook if you're curious what the bit-level encoding difference is
between these.  I try to make most of the tests neutral to that kind
of phenomenon but missed this instance of it. If you ever need to
write tests for floating point code, you'll likely experience the same
kind of pain. Something to look forward to&#x2026;

Still not sure what the difference between Unix and Linux is, but
they were a cool aside to the course.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
UNIX is the family. Linux is a member of the family, though sort of an
"adoptive member" as it was created independently as a free version
that mimics the characteristics of the originals. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Unix">Wikipedia
article</a> has a good account of where Linux joins the party as well as
this family tree of UNIX.

When downloading projects early, oftentimes there will be small
problems that Prof K. will address. A simple 'make update' would
solve this. However, I noticed that 'make update' would not update
any comments already in my code which would cause future headaches
(due to not fully implementing a function properly). While not a big
deal, it did cause some inconvenience. Also, the numerous typos
within comments would bug me lol.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I've though about this some and don't have a good solution. I will
continue to make mistakes and am also bugged by typos though resigned
to the fact that I won't catch the them all.  The general problem of
allowing for an update to occur that modifies the code you've written
is a bit dangerous: we'd risk overwriting your stuff which would be
bad. To that end, it's not likely that we can achieve a seamless
solution to updating inline comments (some students don't even copy
them over) and simply have to rely on your reading the updated version
of the project description.
</p>

Most recently Lab12 also had tests which depended on grace and would
fail and then pass after changing no code.

That's performance for you: depending on prevailing conditions,
sometimes its fast and other times less so. It's important to me that
we teach something about coding for performance but that doesn't make
it easy.

<li><p>
Maybe it's just me, but when all three parts of a project are
unrelated (like in project 2), I'd prefer to have them more
separated, like in different zip files when we download them just
because, even though which files are for which are listed in the
project description, it gets just a little bit confusing. Not that
big of a deal, though.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Different strokes for different folks. I agree that problems in
project 2 are less but it's much simpler to administer to have
students download one zip versus three.

I wish we covered some of the more occasionally used language
features in C. We skipped over some stuff I had learned on my own
like variadic functions and function pointers, which aren't covered
in 132 and I feel should be explored by this point. Also wish we
spent a little more time on gcc/makefiles, compiling and linking,
and stuff like using dynamic libraries.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I've taught a course like 216 at another university. The topic
selection in that course was such that we did talk about several of
these things with compiling, linking, and libraries being core topics
in the course. That curriculum was different as student were required
to take a second systems programming course where system calls,
operating system interfaces, threads, and various other topics were
covered.  That also allowed discussion of additional OS topics like
pipes, signals, sockets, semaphores, and a deeper dive into file
systems.  
</p>

<p>
When I arrived at UMD a few years ago and was assigned to teach
CMSC216, my reaction to the topic coverage was "Yeesh, it's like the
topics from two required courses were just pasted into the a single
course."  I learned recently that's because it is: UMD's CS curriculum
used to have a required intro computer systems course and a required
advanced computer systems course, just like my last university.  At
some point long before my arrival, the curriculum was reformed with
most topics from the two required courses merged into CMSC216. That
doesn't leave a lot of space to breath and some hard calls need to be
made about what's actually done in the course.  
</p>

<p>
If you want more info on compilation and linking, Bryant &amp; O'Hallaron
Chapter 7 has excellent information with coverage of separate
compilation, linking, loading, and dynamic libraries. If you poke
around the internet, you can probably find some of my old slides on
the topic for additional support. As they say, "Never stop learning."

more from the textbook. While this was challenging as the way the

Awesome. Learning to read technical literature unlocks myriad

I didn't like the fact that private questions on piazza were not
answered as fast as public ones.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Private questions could only be addressed by staff and usually
involved more analysis as it pertained to a specific rather than
general situation.  That's just the nature of the business. As you
go forward, if your inquiry is very specific, expect it take longer
to find answers.

I wish that Professor Kauffmann could give us an estimated time to
complete each problem in the projects so that we could schedule time
to work on the project accordingly, and if we did not complete the
problem within the estimated time then we will know something is
wrong and to go to office hours for help.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Such as estimate would have such high variance as to be
useless. Students finish project problems between 1 hour and 1
week. Perhaps it might be good to warn students that if their pace for
completing problems does improve over a project, they should seek
help: if problem 1 takes 3 days AND problem 2 also takes 3 days,
something is probably wrong. The trouble is that students are so
variable as well. Some will hammer on problems on their own trying the
same tactics over and over and getting the same errors over and over
then complain that it take too long. Others will not work on the
project unless they are sitting in office hours being told what to do
by a TA and then complain there aren't enough office hours or TAs to
get the project done. One of the joys of being a unique snowflake is
that you have to figure out what works for you yourself and what your
individual strengths and weaknesses are. If you finished the projects
at all, that's great. If you learned something from them, that's the
point. If you want to do them faster, come see a staff member as
sometimes you need to be walked through some processes so you can
adopt them for yourself. Generally I'd say if your stuck on a
bug/failed test for an hour, take a break, try another 30min, then go
find help. But if you're stuck because you don't know how to write a
function at all, read some, study some lecture notes, and try some
things first. The point is to learn to write code yourself. If you've
not done that a lot, you'll take more time than those that are more
practiced.  That's expected and normal. But it does make it hard for
us to give estimates on how long it will take you to do things.

I'm glad that the resources we provided helped you find a firing

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One suggestion that I have for future students is to start the
projects as early as possible, since they will often take you longer
than you may expect. And if they don't, then you're done early!</li>

<li>I REALLY appreciated the project explanation videos. Whenever I
didn't watch them, it always took me way longer to understand the
gist of the assignment and therefore get started in a meaningful way
(in a way that didn't involve just downloading/creating the files
etc).</li>

<li>For future students, assembly is extremely hard, not an
understatement that it's one of the hardest things I've done in my
life</li>

<li>I know my friends liked to skip discussion and never did the hws
(til studying for exams), but I found them VERY helpful; I'm good at
learning through application, so the labs (and ACTUALLY CODING THEM)
made me cement the concept way faster than looking at code during
lecture.</li>

<li>I would suggest to future students that they complete the lab and
homework for a given week before beginning the project. I tended to
work on the project first, but missed the opportunity to learn
material in the lab/hw that would have assisted me in completing the
project.</li>

<li>The more time you spend on any content, whether its a book, math
problem, or Kauffman's project, the more time you have to interpret
and understand the niche, edge cases of the material&#x2013; which are the
parts that generally give you bugs in your code. Start early, finish
late.</li>

<li>The projects (especially the later ones) really frustrated me at
times, but I guess those are just growing pains associated with
becoming a better computer scientist. So now that I get to look
back, I think it will be good for future students to get to
experience the same difficulty or harder.</li>

<li>Start projects early, try and retain all available engagement
points, go to discussions for the labs, have fun!</li>

some of them will heed that advice and sidestep the pitfalls that all

It was fun gaining a bit more insight on how blood gets rendered in
game engines.

So much can be learned from games and blood&#x2026;

I'm a computer engineering major, and I feel like this class was the
most engineering-like cs class I've taken so far, which was pretty
cool.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
CS is a young discipline formed from the hybridization of math
(analysis and theory) and engineering (computer hardware). I'm told
that UMD's CS department has its roots from the math and science
realms which, confirmed to some extend by the <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/photohistory/">department history
available online</a> (you can read more on history of the department <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/about/history">here</a>
if you're experiencing insomnia). That means the culture of the
department will have a bit of a mathy/theory bent. When I arrived
here, a few years ago, another faculty member commented that UMD is
"theory-oriented". My own education was at the University of Minnesota
where the department grew from the engineering disciplines and had a
strong emphasis on hardware for much of its history. While every
instructor imbues their courses with some particular flavors, likely
you can trace some of my flavor back to the institution that formed me
that emphasized practical considerations. I'm glad what we did worker
for you.

<p>
Perhaps you just need a cooking lesson. Try this one from one of my
mentors. Personally I think he'd make an excellent graduation
speaker.

Student Feedback:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text">I came in knowing Java,
C# and Python too,
I heard the tales from people loudly praising what you do.

I heard the horror stories,
that you were just too hard.
You got into their systems and you left their minds all marred.

I learned about you deeply,
about your pros and cons.
You pointed out what I could to do from right to (very) wrong.

I learned you were obsessed,
with your fruitful memory.
You liked when your things were allocated or were free.

I found that I could see,
that you were troubled or disturbed.
I took things slowly, step by step, until I had you cured.

I learned that one can go
even deeper than they should
moving registers around (in a much more sour mood).

I learned about your writings,
and how you wrote out every word...
You write words with these numbers? How comically absurd...

I learned about your home,
where you move bits all around,
in magnetic spinning disks (which continues to astound).

I learned that you could spin,
many threads into your realm,
to carry out your duties while you stayed at the helm.

I learned about your children,
and your many family trees,
I never knew that some were orphans (let alone zombies).

I thought I wasn't ready,
to get to know you all to well.
But, C, you are wonderful (as far as I can tell...)

I've learned a lot about the workings of the world's computers
Thank you, 216, but also, what rhymes with computers?
