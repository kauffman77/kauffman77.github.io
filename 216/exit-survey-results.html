<li>The one project that I did not enjoy and found the most difficult
was Project 3. Additionally, I was being a bit cocky which resulted
in incomplete projects, which is completely my fault. Lesson

<li>Puzzlebin took a part of my soul that I'll never get back, but

Many folks responding took the time to reminisce about the gauntlet
that is assembly programming and debugging. It may be that I am simply
perpetuating the pain inflicted on me in a bygone era, SSH-ing into a
server until 2am and attempting to crack the mysteries of an assembly
binary bomb via GDB. While this is not a skill I've oft employed since
then, I did benefit from the experience as it taught me one doesn't
have to fully understand a system to make some forward progress in
it. I've also never been afraid to fire up a debugger since then.

<li>Project 5 took too much time and there wasn't enough time. It
should've been released before thanksgiving break.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
I've released projects prior to Thanksgiving before and gotten equal
complaints about how I was forcing students to work on their project
during a holiday. There is no winning on this account. I'm sorry that
you would have preferred it that way rather than the post-holiday
release. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Although the projects were the most time consuming part of the
course, I think they were the most informative.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
That is my intent so I'm glad it worked for you.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I feel like if projects focused on just the key principles rather
than going above and beyond on the depth of material, it would be
equally effective.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
I'd need more detail to act upon such a suggestion. For example, one
could have students just write some <code>fork() / exec() / wait()</code> lines
in a <code>main()</code>. I provided examples of this in lecture and had lab
exercises which amounted to this style.  But a Project is something
that applies course topics in a practical and useful setting. That
means there will be surrounding infrastructure such as was the case in
P4.  If you see some portions of the project that could be excised
there or on other projects while retaining their use of core
techniques and usefulness, please email me <code>&lt;prof@umd.edu&gt;</code> to
discuss. This is an excellent exercise: what can be removed /
re-designed / improved. You might find on trying it is hard to reduce
the size of projects without sacrificing something. The size of
software will also be constrained by the inherent complexity of the
problems it addresses. Reasonable sized problems require some girth to
the software.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Another thing is that the projects are fairly lengthy and I wished
they were a tad bit shorter. It may just be me being terrible at
managing my time but I still feel that even if I managed my time
properly the projects would still feel very lengthy and take up a
good amount of time during my day just to finish parts of the
project.</li>
<li>I think while the projects were informative, they were extremely
time consuming and a lot longer than projects that a lot of my peers
and I have done in the past.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Time spent on projects is time spent practicing our craft.  If you
want to learn to build things, then practice building things. Building
real software is no easy task and we built some approximations of real
software this semester. Be proud of that as it will prepare you for
the wild.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You have the hardest projects in my life, like are you torturing us
with these joints.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
If you want the projects to seem easier, take CMSC 412 and build an
operating system. I expect 216 projects will seem like a vacation
after that.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The majority of the time, I would spend 1-2 hours just staring at
the template of the project, not knowing how to even start the
project. This probably wouldn't have happened if I watched the
project overview videos, but oh well.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
I also find starting to be hard.  Students in the past have reiterated
that the intro videos help to break the ice. I'm sorry you didn't have
a chance to use them as such. Look for ways to reduce that starting
activation energy as if you are recognizing that pattern in yourself
now, you'll have several years to learn how to overcome it before
hitting the job market.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Absolutely no disrespect, but whoever wrote the documentation for
the projects had an uncanny and unique ability to write in TONS of
detail and yet remain extremely vague.
</p>

<p>
Again, I mean no disrespect, but somehow the documentation for these
projects was uniquely worthless. I have yet to have a coding project
at UMD that made me feel this way. Normally, I had an immediately
good grasp comprehensively on what a project was meant to do and
what concepts it encouraged to be applied, giving a good idea on how
the functions would interact. But in this class, really bad writing
in my opinion.
</p>

<p>
Kauffman, if you are reading this and you are the one who wrote the
documentation; I am sorry. I mean no disrespect. I never really
asked questions but you seem to be a very generous man, a
knowledgeable professor and have the respect of your students. But
based on my personal and biased experience; I humbly think you
should hire someone to write the documentation for the projects for
you.
</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Thanks for your commentary. I'll admit some bias as well: I laugh when
2nd year computer science students are critical of Project
specification that I write.  Not because the specs are perfect or even
that good: I know they are filled with errors, typos, inconsistencies,
and other warts.  Rather, I laugh with this kind of commentary as
there's nothing to do with it. There isn't a single concrete
suggestion in your feedback of what should actually change. It amounts
to "do better".  If you have some specifics in mind, lay it on me at
<code>&lt;profk@umd.edu&gt;</code>. I'd encourage you to try. It will force you to
consider "how would I do it differently?" and move away from the vague
critique to the specific critique and perhaps ultimately to
construction and creation. Concrete feedback would be like the
following suggestion from a student:
</p>

<p>
"It would be cool if the information for projects was more consistently
split across class website and function comments. Every so often a
crucial detail was on the class website, which took a while to find
since all the other needed information is in the comments."
</p>

<p>
While it didn't give a specific instance, it at least gives me
direction to look between the documentation comments in some projects
and compare them to the implementation details.  The improvement could be a
matter of moving information between the doc comments and spec or
leaving a note to remind to look at the more comprehensive
implementation details described in the spec.
</p>

<p>
It may be that past projects were easy for you to understand because
you were already familiar with most of what was involved. Unless
things were quite odd, you've never written a Ranked Choice Voting
calculation, embedded clock display, testing framework, or memory
allocator before.  You should expect that it's harder to mentally
reason about those things which makes it much harder to code. But,
with that experience in hand, you'll be in better shape to handle yet
more complex software.  Other complex skills are similar: writing,
musicianship, sport, etc., they all seem opaque and extremely hard to
grasp when starting but with steady practice become transparent and
manageable. So it goes for computing and trust me when I assert that
you're just getting started.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8bca705">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I also really wish there was a topic list for the exams because they
would really help students see what to study for exams especially
because there's only two exams each with a lot of content so having
a topic list would just make it feel less stressful while studying.</li>
<li>You knew going into the exam after completing the project beforehand
that you had the skills to come out with a decent grade just because
the projects would teach you 80% of the topics covered on the exam.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
My advice to students when preparing for exams is to finish the
projects then perhaps review them leading into the exam.  A typical
"topic list" is a set of bullet items that students search for in a
browser or notes, write down a quick summary, and therefore fool
themselves into understanding. Exams ask you to apply the things we
discuss in class and that's usually done in projects, labs, and
HWs. That's why I don't provide a "topic list".
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I have been baffled at the discrepancy between the real [exam] and the
practice resources.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
If you like, I can sit down with you and show you analogs of each real
exam problem and where practice material appeared for it in lecture,
lab, HW, and projects.  In some cases, one might need to combine
things learned in several spots to solve an exam problem which is why
having a good grasp on those practice materials is important.  I
admit, students accustomed to seeing the same questions on the real
exam as appeared on practice exams were likely disappointed, but
you're very unlikely to code course projects in an actual job so my
expectation is that you learn to adapt what you know to new situations.
</p>
</blockquote>

<li>course is kinda hard, most people did awful on the first midterm.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Exam 1 median score was 55 / 70 = 78%, a C+ grade.  Exam 2 had a
median of 59 / 70 = 84%, a B grade and the Final exam had a 79 / 100 =
79% median, C+.  These are normal for my runs of this course
historically. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Upping the practice test would be helpful becuase still felt like
practice tests did not match the exam as exam was much more
difficult and i felt really unprepared.</li>
<li>Wished the practice test was more like the real tests.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
I can do that. Based on past student feedback, we added a second
practice exam page posted online too complement the one discussed in
lecture.  I can modify the problems on both to increase the difficulty
somewhat if folks think this would set a better expectation for the
exams. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>More Exams: 3 exams instead of 2.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Several students commented in this way. I'll consider it but there is a
great difficulty with this if students want a review period (e.g. a
lecture devoted to a practice exam).  That means an exam cycle takes a
full week so a third exam would likely mean eliminating a major topic
in the course and require considerable re-organization.  At my prior
university, the equivalent to CMSC 216 was taught as a MWF 50-min
course and so it was easier to do 3 exams and a final.  However, with
the 75-min convention at UMD, something has to go: a major
course topic, review lectures, or a 3rd exam. I opted for the latter
as it seemed the most favorable tradeoff.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I think that the course policies were slightly unreasonable as most
professors allow students to access past exams. Past exams are a
very helpful in studying and they help students learn.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
I can understand giving past exams which involve multiple choice
questions, writing simple functions of 15 lines or less, or similar
shallow / easy-to-construct questions.  This has risks to it as well,
but since generating those kinds of questions is less difficult,
giving all of them away is tractable. I've also noticed that
instructors that do so often don't teach the same things from one
semester to the next so students complain that what was on past exams
didn't prepare them for the present offering of a course. 
</p>

<p>
As you may have noticed, the exam questions I give are dense and quite
challenging to construct. They are meant to reflect specific topics we
covered in this run of the course and I ensure that topics that appear
on exams are scaffolded by appearing on assignments during the
semester (projects, labs, HWs).  Students that complete and own their
assignments report that they feel well-prepared for the exams.  
</p>

<p>
All of that makes me disinclined to give away past exams: they may not
reflect what's covered in the course now, there is already ample
material to study on, and it makes my job much harder as I cannot
re-use any question I've given away publicly.  I understand your
concern as I've heard it before, but your argument is not enough to
sway me.

<p>
Good show.  The best educators can do is to provide opportunities to
learn, possibly with incentives, and hope that students take those
opportunities.  No one can force you to do something.  If you found in
retrospect that a particular activity would have been beneficial,
you're reflecting which is great. Resolve to take advantage of those
opportunities if they come up again.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I felt like discussions would just be better online, I think because
there is no graded work like a paper assignment or a paper quiz, I
lost the incentive to go. If we had discussion online I would tune
into them instead of walking all the way from Prince Frederick to
CSI just to go over a lab and homework I could complete in maybe 30
minutes or so elsewhere.</li>
<li>I really liked the discussion sections and feel like you should work
to promote active sessions because those were super helpful to me</li>
<li>I felt the discussions were ultimately at times glorified office
hours, and were useless to me when I didn't need help.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Folks will experience discussion sections and their value
differently. That is fully expected and if students did not find
attending to be helpful, they were free to spend that time on other
things. For the record, discussions were there to support learning,
particularly completion of Labs and at times Projects.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I think that during discussion sections, it would be more beneficial
to have one meeting per week dedicated to reviewing the content Prof
K covered in the lecture, and the other one devoted to lab work and
walkthroughs.</li>
<li>It would be helpful if discussions also went a little bit over the
homework. From my understanding, Mondays were dedicated to the first
part of the lab and Tuesdays were for the second part, but after
each part, there would be empty time until class ended. For example,
covering the lab on Monday may take 30 minutes; touching on the
homework in the next 20 minutes would help working through.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
I'll consider that as TAs also indicated the bulk of the weekly Lab
seemed to be coverable on Mondays leaving the Wednesday session light
on content. Reviewing HWs and Lecture content are good options to
complement the lab coverage.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Videos should be posted sooner, most notable the discussion
tutorials, they were really helpful but were posted a couple days
late</li>
<li>Some labs did not have videos associated with them which sometimes
sucked (i mean yeah I should've went to my discussion but still).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Videos are popular with students but are extra work for staff. This is
the first semester videos for discussions were provided. The most
timely coverage is gotten by ATTENDING the session your registered
for. Videos always came later if at all.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Discussion could be changed to be some sort of handwritten
practice/review for the week's content.</li>

<p>
Some TAs indicated they might like to do some handwritten worksheets
and such.  Other TAs indicated that they much prefer to actually
code. I'll consider this but there are a variety of  issues associted
with such a change: will worksheet be graded, how they will they be
graded, how will students who miss discussion be given a chance to
make up the credit, and so on.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Most people likely got EPs through Piazza and moreso through asking
questions in lecture, but I am very introverted so I couldn't really
bring myself to ask or answer anything in front of 100+ people, and
the few times I tried I was never called on because of where I was
sitting. I can't think of a replacement/way to rectify this, more
just bringing awareness to it in case it'll be used for a revision
of the system.</li>
<li>The only thing I would suggest is maybe having engagement points for
discussion sections as well.</li>
<li>more opportunities for engagement points</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
I'll consider adding bonus engagement points to discussions. Last
semester this was done but there were notable abuses by students and
general confusion among TAs on how to handle it. One student indicated
they participated 64 times across the semester despite there being
only 30 discussion meetings. While extreme, lecture did not have this
problem.  We can probably resolve this with some training and
discussion might be a good place for students who'd rather not speak
in the large lecture to have a chance to engage.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Something found could be improved was the way engagement points were
calculated because after around 32 lecture participation points it
doesn't benefit the person that much since you need so many more
participation just for 1 more engagement point.</li>

<p>
Correct.  This logarithmic scale is expressly designed to ensure there
is no motivation for students to dominate the lecture discussion.

<li>I have observed in the class that stupid questions get laughed at by
everyone.  So a lot of times, I just did not ask questions.</li>

There were times that student questions generated humor, often due to
an ill-timed question that had just been answered through a lecture
example.  However, I don't recall any authentically posed inquiries
being "laughed at" and I'm sorry that you got this impression. I hope
you still had a chance to get answers through other means such as
after lecture or during office hours. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An added benefit of the bonus points that I experienced was that I
would zone out less frequently as I was constantly trying to prepare
an answer for the next question he would ask.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Glad to hear that the bonus EP incentive helped you zone in.  Mentally
preparing questions while you listen is a powerful tool. It allows you
to check your understanding as you go and prepares you for later parts
of a presentation as you'll be wanting to know things that may be
covered next.  Every talk I go to now I take some notes but also write
questions in those notes as we go. Keep doing that and you'll be
well-versed at absorbing and retaining presentations.

Amen.  I've seen 3-4 iterations of the popular IDE (Eclipse in my

from what these tools provide but their constant interference with just
writing code always seemed like a terrible value proposition to me. We
chose VS Code as our "endorsed" editor because it is reasonably easy
to set up, has a shallow learning curve to get working, and supports
a few plugins that allow for interactions with GRACE. If you found it
worked better for you to use a different tooling, that's great: owning
your own tools is part of this discipline. Vim is a fine editor, just

GRACE is a server and a huge benefit from interacting with it is that
this teaches students about editing code that runs on different system

feedback that graduated students relate: they learned to be
comfortable logging into other machines and getting work done.  GRACE
is tedious as it requires 2-factor authentication and we may use
another, more ergonomic system in the future. However, students should
not doubt the skills they acquired working on remote systems will
prove valuable in the future.

<p>
Since course staff have little control over GRACE, we have to live
with its peculiarities which has proved painful over the last few

provides students with more concordant behavior between where they
write their code and Gradescope. Docker containers are a promising
avenue for this which we are likely to try in the spring.

<li>Please don't use the hash value comparison to determine if I passed
since I don't even know which one I got wrong. I often spent 1-2
hours on the quiz part just to figure out which question was wrong.</li>

<p>
I can see brute forcing the QUIZ answers taking an hour but reading
the questions, thinking about them, experimenting with the provided
code, perhaps discussing with a colleague, and then formulating an
answer should take less time.  The quiz was meant to be somewhat more
challenging by nature of the all-or-nothing implementation. There were
already easy questions on the HW which indicate right/wrong
immediately. Labs are supposed to be a bit more challenging and it
sounds like they were for you. I hope that that actually meant you
learned something from them.

<li>Overall, what I took away from this class is to succeed you have to
do A LOT of outside studying/work which I didn't realize until late
in the semester.</li>
<li>There were points where we were expected to complete a hard project,
lab assignment, homework assignment, and review for an upcoming exam
all in the same week. This would lead to 15-17 hours of working on
this class.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
But you realized it and will be able to act accordingly in the future.
College students aren't often told the definition of a Credit Hour: "A
credit hour is an amount of work that reasonably approximates not less
than one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and <b>a
minimum of two hours of out-of-class work each week</b> for approximately
15 weeks for one semester (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Course_credit#Credit_hours">Source</a>)." That means just for CMSC216, a
4-credit course, students should be spending at a minimum 8 hours per
week OUTSIDE of course meetings working on assignments and studying
course topics.  Perhaps some folks can get away with less but lots of
folks will exceed that minimum. Being a student is a full-time job. If
you treat it as such, then you'll likely get a lot more out of your
education. That's why it's also extremely hard for students to hold
down other jobs or satisfy significant obligations and maintain a good
academic record. Keep at it and ask for help when you need it.

<li>It feels like the offered office hours during those days were
wasted, while the times where I was struggling most typically were
the two days before the due dates which unfortunately landed on the
weekends, which meant aside from piazza, I was sol. (I am not sure
how this can be solved, since the schedule for things to be done is
already fairly packed but I figured it could still be mentioned.)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Scheduling deadline is very difficult as with 550 students, any
deadline will be agreeable to some and disagreeable to some. We
rotated the deadlines a bit but I'm sorry that you got pinched.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The tests and projects were hard, but overall, not being swamped
with thousands of assignments helped to balance this class with
other classes.</li>
<li>I would spend all my time on projects and it destroyed my ability
to focus and do work for other classes and ruined almost every
singly weekend.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Folks will have varying experiences with how much time assignments
take. If you feel like you spent a LOT of time on assignments, take
that as an investment that will accumulate interest and make future
work easier, perhaps opening up later weekends for enjoyment. Also,
see my note above on the time commitment associated with a 4-credit
course.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The first time that I went to office hours, I had around 3 minutes
of TA time in the span of 2 hours. To be fair, that was on project
due date and there's not much you can do to change this.</li>
<li>Office hours is very hectic</li>
<li>Make office hours more spread out amongst TAs.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
TAs had nobody to talk to when deadlines were far and too many to talk
to when deadlines were close. There is not way around this in my
experience.  I'll try to get TAs to have more coverage of hours during
the day but there is great advantage for staff when there is some
overlap of staff office hours, especially near deadlines.

<li>But it was very disappointing when I would start my projects as soon
as possible and my peers would start later then finsih before me.
Im not sure why but I just suck at coding lol.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Consider your sample. You might be seeing a few folks that have quite
a bit of prior experience in CS or specifically in the topics covered
in this course. If this is your first time coding in any of the
environments we covered, then you should expect to take longer than
folks who already have some training. This would be the case if you
were running with an experienced marathoner: they'll be faster. LOTS
of students struggled in this course but that struggle is a sign of
actual growth. Consider, then, that you grew more during the semester
than those same colleagues. And for the record, EVERYONE sucks at
coding: it is ridiculously hard and unnatural to humans.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I felt that although the slides were informative, they lacked the
syntax required to help me complete the labs/projects. Many times I
found myself relying more on sites like geeksforgeeks for syntax
because not all of the syntax was covered in the slides. I felt this
was different than my previous cs classes where I could resort to
the slides to learn everything needed to complete the projects/labs.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
I'd like more specifics on "lacked the syntax required". Just for
lecture, I provided about 8300 lines of example codes to complement
what we did in lecture.  While it's fine to get alternative
perspectives, I'm continually amazed at the student attitude of "never
mind this prof I've paid several thousand bucks to teach me and the
textbook/slides/codepacks they've told me to read, I'm just going to
google for this thing and trust the first link that pops up."

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I think there should be a better way to track your grade in this
class instead of entering our scores and finding out ourselves using
the grading calculator.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
You want me have your up-to-date grade posted at all times.  Sorry,
but no. If we had a simpler scoring system that didn't have
engagement, late submission, bonus credit, regrades, a sophisticated
autograder system, and so forth, this would be easy to do. But, we
have those things. So you have to punch some numbers into a web
calculator. A calculator that I wrote for you.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I have nothing else to add, but I will say one last time how much I
truly hate assembly and I hope it is un-invented.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
To "un-invent" assembly would be to un-invent CPUs. That's likely to
have a deleterious effect on the availability of programming jobs.  I
saw a talk a while back where the speaker was railing about how
obscene Assembly code is and how ridiculous it is that it still exists
in this advanced age. It was very apparent that this person had never
taken a computing systems course and didn't really understand how
silly their argument seemed. What would you replace assembly with?
Rust? Make me a processor that executes Rust natively and I'll get
behind you.  On trying, you'll find it's intractable and will settle
for a CPU that has an assembly language.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>While difficult, and needing frequent help, I feel that all my
struggle helped me in the end - I learned what I didn't know/what

That is my goal for everyone in the course: well done!

<li>about the textbook, I recently used it to do some optimizing for the

explained optimizations. The problem is I didn't really use the

ever enough time, but I feel I would have benefited if I did.</li>

<p>
Glad you liked the textbook. Some folks can't stand it but it is among
the best CS textbooks I've ever encountered and I benefited greatly
from reading it when it was in it's Alpha version while I was an
undergraduate.  These days we have a rich set of information, web
sites, videos, etc. But textbooks are still my favorite: they don't
have ads, you don't need to subscribe to them, they have infinite
battery life, and most of them contain very good information. If you
learn how to read books, you'll always have a wealth of reliable
information available to you.

<li>It assumes we know so much from CMSC132 and 131 despite C being a
completely new language which was super frustrating.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
C is not completely new. In fact, Java borrowed heavily from C and C++
so much of the syntax should be familiar to those coming from
Java. The expectation that you know things like variables, functions,
parameters, conditionals, loops, is stated up front.  I'm sorry it was
frustrating for you but generally your courses will build on each
other in sequence. That's the nature of a college curriculum.

all the students acted like they knew everything and seemed to

not the fault of the professor though and it is a deeper issue with
STEM courses).</li>

This was not my experience this semester and I'm very sorry to hear it

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I feel like projects are what I learned the absolute most
from. Especially when compared to preparing for and taking exams,
completing projects offers a much higher return in terms of
understanding computer systems, C, assembly, etc. Thus, I believe
that this should be better reflected by the grade weights. Of
course, I do not know if this is practically possible
administratively. Perhaps there are certain exam weights imposed
upon Kauffman by the department?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Instructors have broad authority to set up courses as they wish. It is
my decision to weight projects and exams as indicated. Your argument
is reasonable, that projects allow students to grow the most and
therefore should be weighted more heavily. Unfortunately, projects can
also be completed through means that do not lead to growth. I cannot
observe students complete project through use of AI, copy off others,
pay folks, and other means. While I catch some of these violations,
I'm certain much of this goes undetected. Rather, I can watch folks
take exams so that they are much more likely to be the sole work of
the individual who turns it in.  This is reflective of many real-world
situations: you may get a little credit for practice and preparation,
but the real acclaim comes from the performance, be it sport, art,
business, etc. That performance usually reflects whether preparation
was authentic or mocked. Exams are our performance.

<li>C is my new favorite programming language.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Glad you like it. Keep in mind that such a statement is equivalent to
a carpenter saying "the screwdriver is my favorite tool". Programming
languages are tools. Make sure to collect several of them so that when
faced with a task, you can select an appropriate tool for the job. I
recommend paying special attention in CMSC330 as OCaml is an
outstanding tool for many tasks where C falls short. I encourage you
to pick up Python and some Scheme to round out your collection. And
AWK; no one loves AWK enough.
