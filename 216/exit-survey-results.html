<li>My suggestion for future students would be to make the slides more
descriptive and the wording more simple for each topic and their
nuances, just as in CMSC131 and 132.</li>
<li>I noticed somewhat of a disconnect between the lecture slides and
the lectures themselves. In particular, there were often details on
the slides that were never referred to out loud. For me at least,
this made the presented information feel a bit more overwhelming
than necessary. A suggestion I would have for the future is to
either omit the unmentioned details from the slides to prevent
confusion, or touch on every point on every slide.</li>
<li><p>
I really appreciated the detailed slides available on the website so
I could review those when I couldn't make it to lecture.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I appreciate specific feedback on slides that might be confusing and
need improvement. If you have any, email me. Several folks mentioned
the slides are "dense" which can be good or bad according to your
preference. Since most students don't bother to read anything beyond
slides (e.g. read associated textbooks), I've upped my slide density
somewhat to try to make things self-contained with varying degrees
of success.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
Bonus engagement points incentivized the asking of questions that
reduced the engagement of others.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Interesting take expressed eloquently. I'm not sure I agree. However,
I do now have a great question to ask in the next semesters survey:
</p>

<p>
When other students ask questions during lecture, I find&#x2026;
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I am interested and learn things from the answer</li>
<li>I feel neutral as some questions are informative while others are
less so</li>
<li>I am bored as most of the questions don't reveal anything new to me
nor confirm that I understand the topic being discussed</li>
</ol>

<p>
I suppose I could also just pose it as an agree/disagree with your
well crafted statement. The answer is in the future.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li>I didn't really like the idea of questions for engagement points
because I didn't have any questions some times, but I did need some
extra engagement points so I kind of felt like I should make up a
question or two just to get the points. If I had a genuine question,
I'd ask it regardless of whether or not I'd get points for it since
I'd be interested in learning more.</li>
<li>I also was too intimidated to go up to the front and give myself a
dot even when I did participate.</li>
<li><p>
By removing the ability to collect engagement points from class, I
feel that classes will be more informative and filled less with
ridiculous questions and comments being asked by students just so
they can earn an engagement point (I recall that you called out
someone for using ChatGPT to ask a question).
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
As engineers, consider the tradeoffs of what you are
suggesting. We've all been in courses where asking questions is
borderline taboo as they are met with irritation or derision. I
found those experiences dissatisfying when I was a student. I would
like a balance of interaction but favor more rather than less. I am
very willing to tolerate some "dots farming" attempts or tangential
questions if it fosters an overall open atmosphere of inquiry. I'll
take 3 irrelevant questions if it encourages a genuinely curious 4th
questioner.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
One of my friends said he witnessed someone fill in 8 bubbles at the
same time [for bonus Engagement Points]. Maybe he just forgot to
fill them out earlier? We'll never know. Whether he was honest
doesn't affect me, but perhaps emphasizing a deterrence for being
caught (ie loss of all engagement points) would help make the system
as a whole seem more fair to those who are honest. But then again,
that's a lot of effort for you to go through and it doesn't seem
that worth it.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I've used "honor" systems like this many years prior and folks
generally abided by them without need for any special action from me:
if a student didn't interact with me during lecture, they didn't fill
in any dots; if they did interact, they filled in 1 dot. I expected
the same to be true at UMD but have been proved wrong. One person
wrote down 63 dots for their discussion participation. We only had about
30 classes last I checked. I will likely institute some more checks
and balances as it seems a small number of students are unashamed to
just blatantly give themselves credit for things they haven't done.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li>Lectures are also super dry which makes it so much harder to try to
learn anything from them. I get that it's a weed out class, but
please, I'm not even a CS major or minor anymore, just let me live.</li>
<li><p>
I love your energy &amp; style. The time for discussion is awesome and I
love the opportunity to immediately apply what I learned instead of
just listening to a lecture (as awesome as they are).

<blockquote>
<p>
You can't please everyone&#x2026;

<li><p>
Sometimes Professor Kauffman would be witty with students asking
stupid questions or asking something that was already asked - I
liked this as it prevented people asking dumb questions, but it also
personally discouraged me from asking questions in lecture when I
needed clarification.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Sorry to hear my "sassyness" discouraged you from participating. If
you find it hard to speak up in that way, look for a an alternate
place to get clarification: piazza, office hours, email. Generally
questions asked with genuine curiosity are never dumb. Sometimes they
can be ill-timed: we talk about something for a while and I need to
move us forward but someone missed something so wants to revisit it.
That can frustrate me and it shows sometimes.

Going to office hours really helped for 216 since the TAs helped.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Glad to hear it.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
I've also had friends say that they did not like certain TAs because
of comments [the TA made]. I DO NOT believe these comments were
meant maliciously, but the TAs should understand that their comment
may discourage students if said carelessly.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A large fraction of TAs were first-timers and are still learning how
impactful their interactions with students can be. I do my best to
impress on TAs that our job is to assist students moving
forward. Sometimes that involves being honest about students being
behind or not showing enough effort. Other times human frustrations
can get the better of us all and we may say things we regret. I'll
keep reminding the staff to be firm but gentle with students to avoid
any inadvertent discouragement.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
The office hours can be improved. Sometimes, especially before
project deadlines, I am waiting several hours (up to 3) to get help
from a TA. In 132, I never had to wait over 30-40 minutes to get
help&#x2026; I would suggest looking into Nelson Padua-Perez's online
queue system for office hours.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I'm glad you had a good time in 132. You are, unfortunately, wrong
about the queuing system. I used "Quuly" while teaching CMSC330 in
Fall 2023 and it did nothing to diminish the long wait times
associated with office hours in that class.  The fact is that the
content is challenging and there is a high demand from students who
want assistance from a limited number of staff.  Technology will not
fix that and in fact the online Queue system would fail or delete
students sometimes which led to complaints about fairness.  When I
asked TAs mid-spring about whether they thought an online queuing
system would improve matters, they indicated the whiteboard is just
fine. 
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li>I just wish it was easier to meet with TA's, it takes generally on
average 30-50 minutes to meet with them and at that point I wish
they had zoom sessions more often.</li>
<li>MORE TAs for Office Hours when project due date is near</li>
<li><p>
I think that in office hours there should be some rule when busy
that a ta move on after 10 -15 minutes with one person instead of
spending like 30 minutes. Sometimes I go into office hours and wait
up to 2 hrs before getting help from a ta.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Office hours can get pretty busy, especially close to deadlines.
Staff are under instruction that they should spend 10-15 minutes on
any one student before cycling to the next person.  Folks have varying
levels of proficiency at managing this and sometimes get hung up on an
individual with a tricky problem.  
</p>

<p>
We are likely to adjust allocations of TAs between discussions and
office hours going forwards especially close to deadlines. This may
help somewhat with the crunch close to deadlines. However, this is a
perpetual problem that I've never solved over my teaching career. If
you give students challenging projects which force them to master new
skills, many of them will put off doing it to later than they should
then get caught in a crush with their peers at the last minute.
</p>

<p>
One thing that hurts office hour throughput is something I directly
observed on the day Project 4 was due. I spent 7 hours helping
students in office hours. During that time, every student who came got
helped, usually within an hour of their arrival. This would have been
smaller but for the fact that students, on getting helped, would
immediately add themselves back into the queue. Some even wrote their
names down in the queue in multiple spots. This tactic meant that on
arriving to help a student, they wouldn't have a specific question in
mind and might just say "come back to me later."  This isn't really
how office hours should work especially close to a deadline.  Having a
specific issue that you need help to resolve is the intended
purpose. It's fine to "hang out" if there's no one waiting, but when
there are lots of folks who want help, milking staff for information
as often as possible gets in the way of helping others in a timely
fashion.  I don't have any way to avoid this mind yet but I'll be
working with staff on how we might set policies to prevent or at least
limit this tactic.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
AVW 4166 is awful, please get a room with a window for office hours.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Amen to that. AVW 4166 is getting a modest renovation this
summer. There won't be windows added, but it will be reconfigured to
give more space, more whiteboards, and should feel a little less like
an afterthought.  I was pretty shocked when I joined that a top-10 CS
department doesn't have a better place for students to get help but at
least my pestering is moving us a little forward.

Coding and debugging assignments takes a long time and a ton of
focus, especially the thermostat projects, and I often found myself
without the mental bandwidth to avoid falling behind. I feel like
more lenient/flexible due dates or longer submission windows
would've helped a lot.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Most projects had a 9-14 day turn-around from first release to on-time
deadline.  Sorry to hear that timeline and our existing late policy
wasn't sufficient for you.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
Project 4 had tests for functions that did not effectively find
errors in the code. For numerous of the first couple functions from
the project, I passed all tests with code that failed other
function's tests later down the line when the new functions called
old ones.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
While I try to write software tests in a linear fashion, this turns
out to be very hard to do in all but trivial cases. P4 was not
trivial. With 450+ students banging on a new project, I'm not at all
surprised that some students found a way to write incorrect code that
passed some tests but needed to be adjusted once it was subjected to
more rigorous testing. I'll likely adjust the tests somewhat for this.
</p>

<p>
Before I'd take your criticism too much to heart, I'd like to see the
tests you wrote and how well they ferreted out bugs
early. 
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li>Maybe put a little less emphasis on handwriting assembly while still
making sure the concept gets across.</li>
<li><p>
The assembly project took me 50 hours to complete but It was my
favorite project.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It is a mistake to think you can know a thing without doing it.  Even
if you listen to music a LOT and talk about it, most of you would
understand making music via voice or instrument is another beast
entirely.  You would not know assembly without actually writing
something appreciable in it yourself.  This course requires that you
know a bit of assembly so we write it. There is no other way.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li>I thought the projects were a little excessive and hard. I felt a
spent a lot of time on them but didn't even learn that much from
them. I felt there were better ways to learn the content of the
class rather than sitting there for hours on end trying to debug my
code.</li>
<li><p>
I liked the informative nature of project structures, as they
incorporated both real-world use cases (such as the bakefile project
or the low-level thermistor code) as well as general C and assembly
concepts (such as puzzlebox and puzzlebin). I enjoyed this structure
of projects and think that it should stay that way.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I'd be happy to talk to anyone about what they did or did not learn
from projects.  If I can have a serious conversation with someone who
completed the projects and thinks they didn't teach anything and be
convinced by their arguments, I'd be willing to make changes to the
projects. That hasn't happened yet. I'll admit that some students may
know some or all of the lessons projects are meant to
demonstrate. However, that is different than projects not achieving
their goal: to make someone unfamiliar more familiar and more
capable. There is not substitute for time and practice to make that
happen so expect that going forward.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
I found it very annoying and stressful when the projects and labs
had multiple bugs in them, especially with project 4. There were
just way to many things wrong with the project on released and it
discouraged me from working on it.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Sorry that there were bugs. I don't like them either. Understanding
and coping with uncertainty is an important part of our discipline:
customers change their minds, other teams adjust their designs,
vendors provide buggy services that you must work around, and so on.
If you are discouraged by the issues that came up in these projects
which are nearly completely canned, you'll want to start broadening
your mindset somewhat as a career in software engineering involves a
LOT about managing and confronting bugs.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
Projects are a bit too big: maybe do 10 smaller projects rather than
5 larger projects
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
No. If you want to learn to build big things, build big
things. These projects are not big. My solution to P4's Bake system
was 600ish lines with comments. In the scheme of software that is
minuscule.  GNU Make is 36,000+ lines of C with comments and it's
not even that big. You only learn certain things about coding if you
code larger systems. These are important things like the value of a
garbage collector, whether a class hierarchy is well-though, and why
interfaces/traits are preferable to inheritance.  Most importantly
you start to learn the limits of your own mind and how good design
and engineering practice can help you work around them.  Take on
bigger projects so that your abilities expand and you are ready to
do the real work of software engineering.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li>I felt that project descriptions were a little vague at times and
missed important details.</li>
<li><p>
The project instructions were sometimes almost too detailed,
especially in how they frequently outlined exactly how a method
should run, and that may have detracted from learning a bit.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Folks want different levels of detail in their descriptions. The
sign of a good compromise is that no one is completely happy.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li>I took CMSC131 and 132 here at UMD and found the projects to be
absolutely the most soul crushing, headache inducing, frustrating,
assignments I have ever done. BUT they were VERY INSIGHTFUL on how
coding is used in real life.</li>
<li><p>
Though the projects were difficult, I felt that they prepared me for
the exam in a way that I would barely have to study for it which was
awesome
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
That's the idea and I'm glad it worked out for you.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
The fact that we couldn't convert our project extra credit to
engagement points. I feel like that would have motivated me to push
myself and do more of the extra credit since I'm driven by grades
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It's good to understand your own motivations. It gives you the
opportunity to consider their utility. For example, in 3 years, you
wont' have grades anymore. You'll need to find a new surrogate for
that. Perhaps it will be advancement in a company. Five years later,
when you find out it's hard to advance in a company as it involves
significant politicking and luck, you find you abandon that external
validation of effort.  Perhaps then you'll start to do extra things
because you enjoy them, because they bring you intrinsic satisfaction.
Makeup credit is optional and it turns out most of the folks who did
it didn't need to make up anything as they were doing just fine on the
projects.  It's there for folks who are interested in doing it for one
reason or another. Consider your reasons and act accordingly. 
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li>PLEASE for the love of god save the pain of assembly puzzlebin and
dont give this on project 3 for future classes, or not (it kinda
helped me learn gdb so i guess thats cool (also caused me to rethink
my career path!)).</li>
<li><p>
It's like Puzzlebox felt analogous to a cute kitten, whereas
Puzzlebin felt analogous to a highly venomous snake.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Puzzlebin is a derivative of <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15213-s02/www/applications/labs/lab2/bomblab.html">long-running assignment by our textbook
authors, Byrant and O'Hallaron</a> which is still used in many places.
I'm likely to keep using it in part due to the challenge and due to
urging from TAs that they felt, with some minor tweaks, it really
forced students to get sharper in terms of their GDB skills and
knowledge of how to interpret assembly. Don't let that assignment
scare you: it's a rare job that will have you doing binary
disassembly. However, it does cement the idea that one can never
entirely hide code from those running it, an important lesson for
all coders to internalize.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
I see a few typos in the comments in the projects.

the associated lab, the project content would be significantly
easier. This turned out to be true, and was definitely one of the
more helpful parts about the class.</li>
<li><p>
Labs felt properly built into the course material because the TAs
had to introduce the content so that we could complete them, and
then the information was reinforced and elaborated on in the lecture
the following day. I would not change anything about how homework

I think it'd be best to standardize the discussion recordings more
so that each recording has a portion reserved for discussing the
learning object for that week, while the other portion may
demonstrate just a single part of the lab to get us started.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I've never had TAs record discussion demos before. I'm not sure I'll
continue to do so as it is a burden on staff and I'm not sure how much
benefit it really provided. Students who want a demo can come to
their discussion section. Students that want to do the lab
independently can stay home.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
For engagement points, it was not very clear how they worked in
discussion sections as some TAs said that only answering Qs gives
engagement points, some said asking Qs also gets points, some gave
bonus points randomly - so the number of points you got felt a
little arbitrary. Maybe just giving having students check their name
for attending discussion section could be a more straightforward way
to distribute points.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This was a point of difficulty. I'll address it next year by giving
more clear guidance to TAs about how to administer dots in discussion. 
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
I think it would be helpful for TA's to spend less time in the
beginning explaining the concepts of the lab or demoing and more
time at the end to walk through and explain the answers for the
lab. Having time to try to figure out things on our own and then
having the TA's show us how something should be done would be
helpful in learning more from the lab exercises.

Interesting suggestion. We might try a "sandwich" model next year:
brief intro, work time, and wrap-up answers at the end. I'll talk it

I appreciate your honesty. Keep in mind that "fault" can be a hard but
fickle master. There were a lot of things I know I could have done
better while leading this course. But my mom died. It's hard to say if
my not trying harder is my own fault or it's because events totally
out of my control sapped my will never giving me the chance to perform
my best.  There aren't answers to those questions. Just be easy on

This is a course about computing systems.  It does not have a

on our plate and I'm not inclined to just adopt other complex
subjects like effective coordination.  If you are interested in
those very worthy topics, I encourage you to study them. You're
likely to find that, for a team to be effective, its members must
have some individual capability that they can contribute.  Early
courses in many academic curricula are designed to ensure students
who move through them gain that ability to individually contribute
to a team. Only then does it make sense to start studying how to
coordinate a group of effective individuals.  There are
opportunities to collaborate with others on labs, HWs, and general
study. However, if teamwork were a primary part of this course, we
would spend time educating you on how to be a team member. We don't
have time for that and I'm not sure this is a good moment in your
career for it anyway. Look forward to other courses where you'll
have those opportunities.

Posting on Piazza would take a lot of effort for a simple fix.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Try StackOverflow and you may find that our Piazza board is quite
forgiving by comparison. The act of effectively describing your
problem is the first step to solving it. Doing so often presents you
with an opportunity to address the problem yourself so it is worth
the time and effort.

I found it difficult to follow along with the lectures and video
descriptions as Professor Kauffman would tend to ramble and I would
soon lose the purpose of the topic we were covering. I feel like
maybe condensing the content into something more concise will help
students better understand the content. Especially in the project
description, I feel like an hour long video is too long and that
students would better benefit from maybe a 30 minute video at max.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
You're welcome to not watch any of the videos I've posted. While I
certainly carry on sometimes, I put out materials that some folks say
they find useful. If a 60-min video to cover P4 is too long, perhaps
just watch the first 30 minutes of it?  Students tell me they often
watch some of the video. Work on relevant parts, then come back and
watch more when they get to that part of the project. I guess that's
the beauty of a video.

I wish your course was catered towards students who only take this
course because its mandatory, and don't share the same excitement as
you (prof K) and other high achieving students do.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This course is not mandatory. There are plenty of things you can do in
life that don't involve C, assembly, and systems programming. There
are plenty of majors that you can pick that don't have CMSC216 as part
of their curriculum.  However, every CS program I know of has a
computing systems course at some point as it some of the most basic
fabric that constitutes our craft.  You don't have to love this stuff,
but you do need to know it's down there and will likely be down there
throughout any career in computing.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
I think every CMSC216 TA deserves 10 million USD.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I second that sentient and forward the bill to the CS department. My
guess is that we'll have to settle for occasional pizza.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
VSCode itself is fine but I feel like it ultimately makes the class
way easier if you allow them to use this very familiar tool.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This was course about computing systems.  The editor or IDE one uses
doesn't have that much bearing on those topics.  We do try to address
some tangential topics like learning to work with a remote system and
gaining familiarity with basic UNIX command line interactions.
However, they are somewhat incidental and we are definitely not going
to take on effective code editing.  In that respect, I'm very happy
when folks can use a familiar tool to work on course topics. It
helps teach that the topics are not some ancient set of incantations
using archaic tools but are relevant and accessible.  We'll have to
find some other venue to demonstrate that vi is a good editor but
Emacs is good life choice.

<h3 id="org039014f">Advice to Future Students</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org039014f">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>My only recommendation is to students: go to discussion, you can get
help with projects, labs, and everything in between. If your TAs are
anything like mine were, they'll sit with you and work through it
until you get it (or at least until discussion ends) which beats
waiting in a ~hour queue in office hours.  &#x2026;not sure how feasible
it is, but some mixing of office hours with discussions might be
more efficient because I've walked out of office hours when it was
packed with only 2 TAs directly into my discussion which was
basically empty with 4 TAs.</li>
<li>I realize that passively re-reading lecture slides is a very bad way
of studying; I need to actually test myself through actions.</li>
<li>I would emphasize to future students to make sure they also update
their notes while doing the project; I think 1/4 of learning comes
from the projects and makes me realize erroneous understanding of
concepts, etc.</li>
<li>Some suggestions I have for future students is to START PROJECTS
EARLY! Or at least start them asap. Just because you got away with
starting one project late, does not mean you should keep doing that.</li>
<li>I fully understand that whatever I get for my grade for this class
was fully from my own doing,</li>
<li>I think the main reference manual is a great resource that I will
be thumbing through for the rest of my life. The K&amp;R C manual is a
concise book that serves as a great working reference while
programming. Thank you for the books&#x2026;</li>
<li>I also met other students who were struggling and it helped to know
that everyone was in the same boat</li>
<li>I would add that the engagement point policy was kind of complicated
and hard to wrap my head around. But honestly the best approach is
probably to not worry too much about your exact engagement point
amount and just do your best.</li>

<li><p>
Also, in terms of availability for office hours/Piazza, I wish that
more of the TAs committed to their office hour times. At times, they
would cancel and it could be inconvenient. I totally understand that
they're occupied with other tasks outside of CMSC216, but I wish
that more of them offered supplemental office hours for the times
that they missed.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
As students themselves, TAs did have frequent commitments that
interfered with office hours. That said, canceling shortly before
office hours were to occur is greatly frustrating for students. I'll
address this with TAs so they know that this is NOT something to be
done lightly and that frequent last-minute cancellations may cancel
their renewal.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
Personally I think that you should avoid assigning projects that are
split by a notable break (e.g. Spring Break). In my experience,
students tend to burn out before break and do very little work
leading up to it, so having project due a few days after can be a
bit of a shock.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This has alway been a struggle as the middle slice of the course
dealing with assembly often comes in conflict with Spring Break or
Thanksgiving depending on the Spring/Fall semester. I was reasonably
happy with the way to schedule on paper as it gave students about 10
days to complete Project 3 without spring break and more like 20 days
with spring break. Students and TAs though indicated that most folks
didn't bother with the project before break and then were slammed
after returning from break as they were not as well versed in assembly
as they thought.  I'll keep that in mind as I set future schedules.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
My only complaint was that when I was working on it I had to use
gedit, as MobaXterm does not support assembly code editing. This was
fine, but for some reason it was so horrendously slow at the time
that it was like using Google Docs on a 6 year old $20
Chromebook. Also it would just straight up crash at times, deleting
so much of my work. There's nothing that can really be done about
this, but my general piece of advice to future students would be to
write assembly code in a local environment like VS code or even
notepad (which I did).
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I'm overall quite displeased with the infrastructure available for
CMSC 216. GRACE is not a good system and is far below what I'd expect
from any large university with CS department, especially one with the
purported reputation UMD has.  I'll be working to get some much needed
upgrades for GRACE to service this course. We have a lot of students
and require them to do certain things. The least the department can do
is to provide an adequate system that has modern features like proper
remote editing and SSH key support. I'm sorry that you had to crank
your way through this cruddy infrastructure and I hope to spare future
students that unnecessary pain.

so we settled on using vim/gnu screen. I wish the systems were
updated to use packages from this decade! I saw something about it
being better to learn tmux since it's newer, but either Grace didn't

I was forced to learn screen.
