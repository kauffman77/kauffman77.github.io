It seems the projects struck a reasonable balance of difficulty which
encouraged learning. My general impression is that students could
likely handle slightly more challenge in projects so long as the
associated scaffolding is in place so we may up the ante a bit in the
next offering. A notable exception is Project 3's <code>puzzlebin</code> which is
discussed below.

Allowing "click-through" in HW is a bit controversial but it does

<p>
The message here appears to be discussion exercises did a reasonable
job of providing slightly more challenging practice exercises to
students than HW while supporting them through TA
assistance. According to discussions with both students and TAs,
discussion exercises can be made somewhat more dense to hit more
topics without stressing anyone out too much so we are likely to tweak
this for the next round to give students more the chew on for
discussion exercises.

<p>
A common sentiment among faculty is that if they record their lectures
and make them available to students, no one will bother coming to
in-person meetings. My direct experience after making recordings
available since 2020 is that many students are still very interested in the
live experience of being in room and learning together. All recordings
do is make it easier to review or recover if one misses lecture. I'm
glad to see that the student sentiment expressed here continues to
directly support that view and I'll plan to continue providing lecture
recordings.

This is a very encouraging set of results to me as forming connections
during a college career has lasting effects. While an undergrad, I
learned more because I met some folks with similar interests and some
of those friendships have persisted over the past 20 years.  For those
that found it difficult to make connections, don't be
discouraged. There were a variety of courses I didn't meet anyone but
being persistent in your efforts to form a community will pay off in
the end.

<p>
Ah GRACE&#x2026; I'm glad that we had a shared server resource on which
students could do their course business as the alternative is less
palatable: getting students set up with virtual machines on their local
machines has been extremely painful in the past.  That said, GRACE could
use some updates and attention which I'll be attempting to give it
prior to the next course offering. The more ergonomic we can make this
for students, the better.
</p>

<p>
If folks who did manage to VS Code or other systems to work with
remote editing on GRACE would drop me a line, I'd appreciate learning
from what tricks you used get things in order. We'd like to make those
tricks public knowledge so others have an easier time in the future.

One thing that stood out the most to me which I enjoyed was where
you would have Questions mid slides and we were able to discuss and
try to answer it with the people next to us.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Glad you liked it.

When kauffman walks around during lectures while we're supposed to
be doing a practice exercise to make us feel like we have to be on
task, i'd rather he didn't because it feels like high school where
we're being babysat and i just wanna do a crossword in lecture every
once in a while without feeling guilty or getting a dirty look from
the professor
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Ten years ago I got tired of chastising students for playing games
during lecture exercises and don't bother anymore, not even dirty
looks. I try to limit my babysitting as much as possible.  What I'm
sensing, though, is that you aren't totally at peace with your own
decision to duck the exercise and spend time on something else.  If
you were completely comfortable with that action, my walking by
while you filled in a crossword wouldn't be a bother. As Feynman
said, "What do you care what other people think?"
</p>

<p>
My advice: learn to NOT feel guilty if doing a crossword in lecture
is what you're up for. Just keep in mind that a typical hour-long
lecture costs about $10 (in-state tuition for CMNS is $7267.50,
16-credit load with 3 hours in-class per credit per week over 14
weeks: 7267.50 / (16*3*14) = 10.81 dollars per hour in class). I
just hope it's a rewarding crossword at that rate.

<h3 id="orgfca933c">Office Hours</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfca933c">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Other sections had more TA's than us. Every time I go to 216 office
hours are I find TA's from other section setting there doing nothing
and no TA's for our section&#x2026;
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I'll look into this. When I arrived at UMD, I had 0 TAs and had a
hard time figuring out how to get any. That made me a bit salty. I
was given a certain number of TAs and if it is proportionally fewer
than other sections, I'll be even more salty.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
TAs should only spend so long helping a student if several others
are waiting for help.  In 132 the Quuly system worked well for
receiving help and I wished that it was implemented here too.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
My understanding is that Quuly just allows students to Queue for
help. It doesn't stop staff from getting caught up trying squash a bug
for too long with an individual student. I didn't hear that staff had
any particular problem managing the queue of students who wanted
help. If that's the case, I'll want to know about it. However, I fully
expect at times it was hard for staff to get to everyone. I've been
guilty of getting caught up on one problem as well. My general advice
and approach is try to spend about 10 minutes top with any one student
to move them forward and then iterate. I'm sorry that it didn't feel
like staff were clipping along fast enough. Most TAs were
first-timers and still learning the ropes. Overall, I was floored by
how well TAs performed so I hope you don't hold this shortfall against
them. 
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
One thing that has been useful for me in past CS classes is having
some office hours via zoom. This semester I found myself having a
hard time getting to the OH room because of the location of my other
classes and having the option to get help through zoom would have
been really helpful while keeping the option to go in-person as
well.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I discussed the potential for online office hours with staff early on.
There was little enthusiasm to do it regularly. I feel this too:
compared to in-person office hours, online office hours are harder to
pull off right. That said, we want to make sure that help is available
in some form for students in as many situations as we can including
those that aren't coming to campus regularly. I'll recruit some folks
to hold some online office hours next semester to try to meet folks
like yourself where they are at. This is an in-person class so I
expect the bulk of office hours will be in person. You shouldn't
hesitate to ask staff members if you can set up a meeting online to
get help. I expect most TAs and Professors will be open and wiling to
meet you in that capacity.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A course policy I think that was very fair and refreshing was the
open-resource exams.</li>
<li><p>
I actually did not like the open notes aspect of exams. For the
first exam I did worse than any exam in my life because I thought my
notes would suffice, and it encouraged me to not study as hard. Then
for the second exam I studied a lot and did much better even though
my computer with my notes on it died five minutes in.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I don't find regurgitating memorized content to be a good assessment
of mastery so I give open resource exams that involve problem solving,
adaptation, and application of skills we've discussed to novel
situations. This is likely closer to what students will face in the
wild so it feels better as an assessment tool. It can be a little
jarring but I'm glad to hear that folks can adapt and find that, with
reasonable preparation, resources actually have minimal impact
compared to mastery of problem solving.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
Add more practice tests.  Solving the practice exam one week before
the exam would be better so that we can have time and be more
prepared for what to expect in the exam.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Several folks asked for more by way of exam practice. Some even
specifically indicated that the HW practice problems aren't good
enough. I'll consider how to expand that element of practice. Writing
good exam problems is a chore but I'm sure I can come up with something.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
More midterms.

Now that is a new suggestion. I'll query the spring sections on

I really didn't like the puzzlebin in assembly. I found the GDB in
assembly to be very challenging. This was especially true because my
GDB kept crashing.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
By far the most frequent element of free-form feedback was "puzzlebin
blows".  I'll first determine why GRACE was causing GDB to crap out
while folks were debugging. It was news to me when every student in
lecture indicated this happened to them.  I had no idea that those
issues were so pervasive.  Assuming that we can get the debugger to be
less flakey, puzzlebin will be more manageable. It sounds like
tweaking the difficulty might be in order as well which is also easy
to accommodate.  Thanks all for letting me know that this one was so
vexing. 
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>The projects were extremely confusing, difficult, and seemed almost
entirely pointless compared to what I might see in the real
world.</li>
<li><p>
I enjoyed that [the projects] were more practical and loosely tied to a
real-world problem.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Opinions have always varied on how "real" projects are. <code>puzzlebin</code>
was definitely the least close to real and chaffed folks quite a
bit. However, every other project problem had some semblance of a
"real" use case. I don't expect students to recognize that
completely but given enough time, you'll see these much of what we
did pop up again and haunt you, hopefully as a friendly ghost. 👻
</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
I think implementing multiple deadlines for individual problems
within a project would help students like me who had a hard time
getting started and pushed everything until the last couple days
possible.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I'll consider this. I tried one semester to implement "milestones"
wherein students needed to pass a certain number of test cases by a
midpoint deadline. Students that semester complained that it was
stressful to have multiple deadlines associated with one
project. There is no silver bullet and learning to at least cope with
the tendency to put things off is an important part of everyone's
development.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
Sometimes there were projects assigned in the day before an exam or
just relatively super close to an exam data.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I do make projects due before exams often. Working on the project
prepares for the exam. I don't recall ever assigning anything
immediately before an exam that is necessary to complete to do well on
the exam.  Remind me if I'm forgetting something that actually
happened. 
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
I enjoyed the projects but I would have preferred to have more, the
first four were good for learning but the last one was a bit too
short.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Likely in the future I'll be able to time the final project a bit
easier to have a second problem on it. That was my intent but time
slipped away and TAs indicated that the 2nd problem I had planned "was
a bit much."
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
I think the projects in general, are much more difficult than other
C projects I've heard of from other classes. I wouldn't be against
having more projects that are much easier to write and gives you
more opportunity and balance with your grade
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Students have suggested in the past splitting projects with 2 distinct
problems into separate, shorter projects. I'll consider that but
scheduling this is hard I'm fairly satisfied with the current
structure.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
My only suggestion is better pacing between the last two projects as
they were released back to back when there's usually a week break in
between the projects.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Thanksgiving is a bit of a pain as it is hard to schedule project
through and around it.  Spring will be different but now that I have a
good idea of the topic pacing for 216, I think the project timing will
improve modestly. Sorry you felt a crunch.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
Most projects offered at UMD involve release or private tests. I
found that not including those tests in this course helped me learn
more. I had a much clearer idea of what to write code to solve, and
felt more incentive to complete the tests. With private tests
specifically, the results often came too late to be useful and felt
luck-based. Overall, I had a much better experience with the
projects in 216 than other courses.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I really, really don't like "secret judgments" in education.  Private
tests fall into this category.  I have a whole spiel that I can relate
about the failings of secret tests and am willing to debate anyone who
thinks they are worthwhile. I'm glad that you found the working with
test results you can see to be pleasant. It turns out if you give
folks a clue about what their code is doing wrong, they might
actually be able to fix it&#x2026;
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
More writing/explanation like in P5-Writeup throughout other parts
of the class forced students to explain concepts for a better
understanding - I liked it.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I'll keep that in mind. It's a suggestion that past students have made
as well and I agree that it allows students to demonstrate a different
and equally important skill set from coding.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org99c6ec7">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For the discussion it would be better if the lecture about the topic
that is on the week's discussion happened before the discussion
itself.</li>
<li><p>
The discussions were also really helpful as they closely aligned
with the projects or exams.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
There were times when discussions topics were  ahead of lecture topics
somewhat. In part this was due to discussion topics being delayed a
cycle or so due to technical problems with GRACE at the start of the
semester. However, it is intended that discussions sometimes introduce
ideas that are filled out in lecture.  This may not be ideal but it is
a reality of trying to do interesting things in discussion that
apply to project work.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
The only thing I would say about the discussion sections is that we
were given way too much time to complete the exercises.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
TAs also commented that there were certain discussion exercises that
were way to short. They've given me some decent feedback on that so
that we can refine them for future semesters. That should allow some
coverage of some topics that were regrettably diminished or cut
entirely. 
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
I think the discussions could benefit from more interaction with the
students. Right now, it often feels like the TAs are in monologue.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Noted: TAs have little training on how to run a discussion and as they
get more experience, I expect the level of interactivity will
improve. I'll pass this comment on to them so that we can work on
greater engagement in the next cycle.

Oh man, that would be so nice. It would be like&#x2026; my last University
which had a reasonably modern, reasonably administered set of Linux
machines with really great connection features, password-free key
authentication being one of them.  I'm working on it but when my

Some important lessons come not from coursework but from the

whenever possible (and it's not always possible), limit your

The only thing that sometimes scared me when working with grace was
that there were times tests just didn't pass when they passed 2
seconds ago. I think this is mostly just a grace issue but I did get
worried when I saw some tests failed randomly on certain projects.
</p>

<p>
This is completely unsatisfactory and I'll be working to correct these

PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!!! PUT THE HW AND DISCUSSION AND ALL
OTHER ASSIGNMENTS ON CANVAS!!!! YOU'RE THE ONLY PROF WHO DOESN'T DO
IT AT ALL AND IT'S CAUSED ME AND MY PEERS TO MISS MULTIPLE MINOR
ASSIGNMENTS IN YOUR CLASS!!!
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I know, I know&#x2026; I've gotten lampooned for this before and I know I
should sync the Gradescope assignments to Canvas so students can see
all their deadlines in the same place. The only thing stopping me is
the tedium: assignment deadlines don't sync between the two systems
(at least they didn't when did this in Spring '23) so that means 5
projects, 13 discussions, 13 HWs, each entered both on Gradescope
and set on Canvas. I'll do it but I'm sure I'll enter some dates
wrong and get griped at. It might be a good time to learn the Canvas
API to see if a script could solve this&#x2026;
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
The entire concept of Assembly was straight up useless and
served no purpose other than to piss me off.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This reminds me of a recording of a talk at a reasonably big
conference where the speaker was ranting in a similar fashion: "It's
202x, assembly is completely irrelevant, there are so way better
languages, why don't they make assembly better and more like
them&#x2026;"  Like the above commenter, it made me chuckle and tune out
as the viewpoint is missing a fundamental understanding of why
assembly exists. It's like a physicist saying "look at how complex
quantum mechanics is; it's much easier to reason about things if we
ignore quantum effects, let's do that!" It sounds silly because
quantum mechanics characterizes reality pretty well. Glossing over
it gets wrong answers and willfully ignores a lower-level of known
truth. In computing, if you are running programs in any language on
a normal computer (e.g. not paper/pencil, not imaginary, not
quantum), the CPU is really executing assembly instructions.  If you
want this to own the "science" part of "computer science", it's best
to make peace with the nature of the beast. It's fine if you wish to
be frustrated when coding assembly and find ways to avoid it
professionally. But being pissed off at assembly is like being
pissed off at quantum mechanics, gravity, or electromagnetism:
you're likely to stay pissed because they aren't going anywhere.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
I know from other students that usually "piping" of processes and
creating MAKE files are covered. The latter seems to be
quintessential so I would've liked to cover it.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Being new, I haven't quite gotten a grip on how other instructors
manage to hit all the topics in the course. I'm getting a better idea
of that and I'd love to add Pipes and Makefiles into the mix. As was
commented earlier, there is some room to grow for the discussion
exercises so I think this is possible. I want to make sure, though,
that as topics get added, they fit in and have appropriate detail
associated with them. Otherwise, students are better off learning
about it outside of the class which is doable for both these topics.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
I think the open resource exams and hand-holding in the projects
make the class a bit too easy.  I'm not saying all the resources
were bad, but if in the future I need to code a block of assembly, I
would have to look things up whereas someone else might just have
remembered from their coursework.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Working backwards, I'd be quite surprised if ANY student a year from
now could easily remember how to code assembly from scratch.  That
goes for those who had closed resource exams.  There are a LOT of
details to remember about C, Assembly, and systems programming.
While memorizing some of it may allow recall for a short time,
everyone will forget those details over time. Being able to use a
resource to quickly re-acquaint oneself is a necessary skill in a
computing career. That's why I favor open resource exams.

I'm glad that you found the course easy. If you were the only
student I was teaching, I could have easily upped the stakes for
you. However, my job is to assess overall student understanding
across the entire population of the class. So far things look to be
about where I'd like them. There is a bit of refinement to do, but I
need to weigh your opinion against those that stated the opposite,
that the course was too hard. As they say, the sign of a good
compromise is that everyone is equally unhappy.

I like the jokes for puzzlebin and loved the Sonic easter egg for project 5.

Sometimes I think Kauffman gets a bit too excited and carried away
with an unimportant topic and then it's difficult for students to
follow along what's going on

It's pretty hard to make C interesting, even a very energetic
person would make me fail to be entertained.
