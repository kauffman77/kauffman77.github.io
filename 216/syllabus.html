<p>
Introduction to the interaction between user programs and the
operating system/hardware. Major topics include C programming,
introductory systems programming, and assembly language. Other
concepts covered include UNIX, machine data representation, thread
management, optimization, and virtual memory. Programming is done in
the Linux Environment.

<h3 id="orgea34e84"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Prerequisites</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
Minimum grade of C- in CMSC132; and minimum grade of C- in MATH141.
</p>

<p>
It is presumed that students will have the equivalent of 1 year of
college-level programming in some high-level language such as Java or
Python prior to taking this course.  The C programming language will
be introduced but not at an introductory level so prior programming
experience is a must.

It is assumed you will have access to a computer with the ability to
edit, compile, and run Linux programs.  Students may attempt to set up
a Linux environment on their own computing device but instructions
will be given on how to access the UMD Grace cluster to use that
environment to run programs in the course.  Most students will opt to
use their laptops to connect to Grace to do remote development for the
course. The first few weeks of the course will cover how to set up an
environment that suits you.  If you have difficulty accessing a
suitable environment, contact the course staff for help.
</p>

<p>
Programs will be evaluated through the UMD's Grace system so it is
imperative that students gain access to this soon. Some tactics to do
so are described here:

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-7">
<p>
<b>Office Hours</b> for staff will be posted on the course Canvas
site. Office hours for all staff are open to all students in any
section of the course governed by this syllabus. No appointments are
necessary but usually students receive help on a first-come /
first-serve basis. Often office hours will become crowded around
project deadlines and students are advised to start projects early,
come to office hours with questions prepared, and be patient.
</p>

<p>
Check our Canvas site to see available office hours and note the
locations: some office hours are held in-person while other office
hours are held via Zoom.
</p>

<p>
Students are strongly encouraged to visit the professor and teaching
assistant(s) during office hours to further their understanding of the
material: <b>we are here to help you learn</b>.
</p>

<p>
Please note that office hours often become crowded close to project
deadlines.  Plan accordingly and set your expectation: last-minute
help is often in short supply.

<h4 id="orgdd8bef4">How should I contact staff?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgdd8bef4">
<p>
Here are common situations for students and the best method to use to
contact staff.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
I want to get some real-time assistance with some coursework.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Stop by office hours online or in preson. Locations and times for
office hours are listed on the course Canvas site. Keep in mind that
<b>office hours get busy</b> around project deadlines so there may be a
queue to wait in to get help.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
I have a question on an assignment or course content and there
aren't any office hours coming up soon.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Post your question on <b>Piazza</b>; staff members check several times a
day and answer questions there. Make sure to post an <b>answerable
question</b> as described in the Etiquette Piazza post and <b>avoid
publicly posting large portions of your code</b>. 
</p>

<p>
You might also try <b>searching Piazza first</b> to see if someone
already asked your question and received an answer.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
I have a logistics questions such as when something is due, when
something will happen, etc.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Also use <b>Piazza</b> for most of these. If a staff member isn't sure how
to answer the question, they'll give you they're best guess sooner and
ask the Professor to confirm later.  
</p>

<p>
Staff will often use <b>Piazza for Announcements</b> such as upcoming
deadlines or canceled office hours. These announcements will go to
student email so check your UMN account regularly.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
I think some of my work was graded wrong and I want someone to look
at it again.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Gradescope</b> has a "Request Regrade" feature which will be open for
students to use after grades are posted. Using this feature will
notify whoever graded your work to have another look. If you cannot
resolve the issue, your grader will involve the professor.  There
are some exceptions to this:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Homework Quizzes allow you to retake the Quiz to improve your
score. No online Regrade Requests will be available, just retake
the quiz up to the deadline.</li>
<li>Discussion Exercises can re-submitted as many times as you like
prior to their deadline and give nearly immediate feedback.  If
you aren't getting full credit and can't figure out why, get help
from staff and then resubmit.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
I need some one-on-one help and I can't make it to office hours to
talk to staff about it.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Email</b> one or two of your favorite staff members to see if they can
meet outside of their normal office hours. If you don't have luck in
the first go, try contacting a different staff member including Prof
Kauffman.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
I had a major life event (got sick / family emergency / mental
health problem) and I'm wondering how to cope with it and this
class.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Email Prof Kauffman</b> as soon as you can. Explain the situation and
we'll work out a plan for how to proceed such as rescheduling exams,
extending deadlines, or providing some additional help
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
I'm going to miss a lecture / discussion meeting. What should I do?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>No special action is required</b>: all lectures will be recorded and
will be viewable within two days of them happening to support the
inevitable conflicts that arise. Discussions have online materials
and are designed to allow students to work through them
independently if needed or to collaborate on with a friend in the
course.

<h3 id="engagement-points"><a id="orga58c674"></a><span class="section-number-3">2.4</span> <a id="org7b9b1a5"></a> Engagement Points</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-engagement-points">
<p>
Throughout the semester, students will have opportunities to earn and
use engagement points. The system is a follows.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Each Discussion Exercise completed earns 1 EP and there are
typically 13-14 of them in a semester.</li>
<li>There will be a few opportunities to take course surveys which earn
1 EP as well.</li>
<li><p>
BONUS Engagement points may be earned through participation in
lecture and by answering questions on Piazza.  At the end of the
semester, the total number of times students participated in these
places will determine their Bonus EPs according to this formula:
</p>

<p>
<i>BonusEP = log2(1 + LectureParticipation + PiazzaAnswers)</i>
</p></li>
<li>Late Project submissions COST 1 Engagement Point per day late.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Each Engagement Point is worth 1% to a maximum of 10% for a student's
overall grade. Each engagement point beyond this earns 0.25% Bonus
Credit to a student's overall grade. This is the sole bonus credit
mechanism in the course so students are encouraged to attend Lecture
and Discussion to earn Engagement points.
</p>

<p>
<b>FAQ: How many Engagment Points do I have?</b> Count the number of
Discussion Exercises you have completed. Then check the participation
sheet in lecture and number of questions you've answered on Piazza and
apply the formula above to get your bonus EPs. Subtract the number of
days late you've submitted.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org362ff05" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org362ff05"><span class="section-number-3">2.5</span> Lectures and "Hot Seats"</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-5">
<p>
Lectures will be delivered in person at the times/locations mentioned
in the course schedule.  During lectures, students will frequently be
asked to work on short exercises with a few of their colleagues.
After working on these exercises, the Professor will select a 1-2
students from the "Hot Seats" section of the lecture hall to discuss
their answers with the class. Showing effort on these exercises will
<b>earn bonus Engagement Points</b>. Hot Seats locations will be announced
at the beginning of the course and are typically the first few rows of
a lecture hall or a few designated tables in an active classroom.
</p>

<p>
All lectures will be recorded and posted for asynchronous viewing
within 48 hours of the meeting.  Students not able to attend lecture
synchronously will miss the chance to ask questions and earn bonus
Engagement Points there but can still earn full credit in the course
through other means of acquiring EPs such as completing required
Discussion Exercises.
</p>

<p>
In the event that the instructor is ill or the University deems the
level of plague too high too risk in-person meetings, Lectures will be
held in a similar format online via Zoom. Updates on any such changes
will be announced to students through Piazza and Email.

<h3 id="orgd9d7dea"><span class="section-number-3">2.6</span> Discussion Activities</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-6">
<p>
Discussion sections meet twice per week in the locations
mentioned. During these meetings, an exercise will be introduced and
discussed which, if completed within the week, will earn 1 Engagement
Point.
</p>

<p>
Students do not need to attend discussion meetings synchronously to
earn credit but during discussion meetings, staff will give brief
demos, group students to help complete the exercises, and be on hand
to help students surmount difficulties. <b>Attending discussion mostly
guarantees earning credit</b> and is <b>a great place to meet other
students in the class.</b>
</p>

<p>
Discussion Exercises are Open Resource and Open
Collaboration. Students are encouraged to work in groups during discussion to
complete the work and can submit their work as a group (one
submission, several students getting credit for it). Generally discussion
work is automatically graded so feedback is available immediately.
</p>

<p>
<b>No late submissions will be accepted for Discussion Exercises.</b>
Deadlines to submit are typically 7 days after release.
</p>

<p>
Discussion Sections that take place close to Project deadlines and
Exams will be devoted to assisting the completion of the project
and review in which case no exercises will required.

an online Quiz. Completing Homework exercises will prepare students to
take the online Quiz.  Homework and Quizzes are Open Resource and Open
Collaboration: students <b>may work together</b> with other students in our
section(s) of the course to complete homework/quizzes and are
encouraged to do so.  Submitting identical answers for
homework/quizzes is acceptable so long as it does not violate the

Students will receive a number of programming projects during the
semester.  Each project will involve writing programs and answering
questions about them to illustrate an understanding of course
material. <b>Generally Projects are Individual Work</b> with sharing of
code or detailed solutions being a violation of the <a href="#orgcb165a2">PRIME
DIRECTIVE</a>. Pay careful attention to the guidelines for each
programming project.  Projects are usually large and require a
significant amount of work to complete.
</p>

<p>
Project grading will include the following elements.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Manual Inspection: Projects will include a checklist of features
of completely correct answers. These usually comprise things that
cannot be easily checked automatically such as showing the process
to reach an answer, inclusion of key elements of an answer, or
style aspects of computer code.  These features will be checked by
graders and assigned credit based on level of compliance.</li>
<li>Automatic Testing: Most projects have automatic tests provided

<p>
There will be a series of midterm exams during the semester and a
comprehensive final exam at the end of the semester. Exams take place
during the regularly scheduled lecture period and are worth a
significant portion of the overall course grade.
</p>

<p>
All exams are <b>Open Resource Exams:</b> unless otherwise specified you
may use any course content during exams including lecture slides, your
notes, the textbook, editors/compilers/shells, and any code the you
have written or received from course staff.  No communication is
allowed during the exam (no email/texting/chat), and no Internet
searches are allowed (do not "google for answers"). In addition, you
may only use exams from previous versions of the course if you
personally took those exams. If in doubt, ask about specifics before
or during the exam.

about the dispute. Raise regrade requests respectfully and
specifically: mention what you think a grader missed in your answer or
why you feel a deduction was unfair. Keep in mind that graders assign
credit based on what appears on the project and exams, not post-hoc
explanations of answers.
</p>

<p>
If a Student and Grader are not able to resolve a grading issue to the
satisfaction of both, the student can <b>ask the grader to consult the
Professor</b> who will review the dispute and resolve it. Students should
ask their grader to do this, not email the Professor directly.
</p>

<p>
When grades are published, there will generally be a <b>1 week window</b>
in which disputes are considered. Failing to request a regrade in that
time will forfeit further opportunity to contest the grade.

<p>
Nearly all cheating in programming can be averted by adhering to the
<a href="#orgcb165a2">PRIME DIRECTIVE</a>. Students may be asked at any time to explain code
or exam solutions they submit.  Inability to do so will be construed
as evidence of misconduct.  More specific guidelines are given below.

<p>
Some coursework is to be done individually, usually programming
Projects and Exams.  For this individual work, the following actions
constitute scholastic misconduct (cheating) and will be reported.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Directly copying someone else's solution to an assessment problem,
including student solutions from a previous semester</li>
<li>Directly copying an answer from some outside source such as the
Internet or friend for a project problem.</li>
<li>Making use of an Instructor Solution manual to complete problems.</li>
<li>Submitting someone else's work as your own.</li>
<li>Using or sharing Exam materials from another student from past
offerings of this course; you may view your own past copies of exams
but not share them with others.</li>
<li>Paying someone for a solutions to assignments/exams.</li>
<li>Posting solutions to any web site including public posts to our
course web site.</li>
<li>Collaborating or copying the work of others during an exam.</li>
<li>Taking another student's code with or without their consent.</li>
<li>Giving another student one's own code on assignments or exams</li>
<li>Aiding or abetting any of the above.</li>
<li>Witnessing any of the above and failing to report it to an
instructor immediately.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>REMEMBER:</b> Once you give away your code/work, you lose control of
it. This may lead to pain in the following non-obvious cases
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Using a public Github repository to track your code allows anyone to
copy it and submit it as their own.</li>
<li>Sharing code with a classmate "just to help them" may lead to them
submitting it as their own, sharing it with others, or selling it
for profit</li>
<li>Giving someone access to your accounts or devices to help them may
mean that they use your account to steal your work subsequently.</li>
<li>Leaving your work open in a public space may allow someone to take
snapshots of your screen and use it as their own.</li>

become one of your Professor's stories.

Any instance of misconduct that is detected will investigated and may
be referred to the Office of Community Standards. The most common
penalty is an F in the course. Be advised that the teaching team will
be employing <b>electronic means to detect plagiarism</b>.  As easy as it
may be to copy code, so to it is easy to detect copies. Keep your nose

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
The purpose of this course is to learn about programming and learning
from other students is a great boon.  To that end, the following
actions <b>will NOT be considered cheating in this course.</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Collaboration on Lab Activities and weekly Homework
Exercises/Quizzes is allowed and encouraged. These are a great
opportunity to help one another on work that counts towards your
final grade. Just make sure that you understand any solutions you
submit as per the <a href="#orgcb165a2">PRIME DIRECTIVE</a>.</li>
<li>Discussing projects at a high level with other course students is
fair so long as no code is shared. Take great care at the point of
directly showing your work to others as your answers are
subsequently out of your own control.</li>
<li>Asking public questions on the course discussion board so long as
limited information about your own solution is included. To convey
details of your solution, use private posts.</li>
<li>Asking any course staff member questions in person or online is
acceptable and encouraged. Staff members may initiate small group
discussions in which collaboration is fine.</li>
<li>Making use of your own code or exam materials which you accumulated
from past semesters of this class or other classes is fine. If you
are retaking the course, make sure staff know this so that no
misunderstandings occur.</li>
<li>If you are unsure whether a given collaboration is fair or not, stop
the activity and clear it with your instructor.</li>
</ul>

<p>
At all times keep the <a href="#orgcb165a2">PRIME DIRECTIVE</a> in mind when studying with other
students.  The above collaborations should be limited to getting
someone over a hurdle, not carrying them across the finish line.

discussions, and exams will differ between sections along with the
overarching schedule.  The policies within this syllabus apply only to
our section and students should refrain from collaborating outside of
their own section to avoid problems. TAs for different sections will
not be able to provide specific assistance on assignments to students
from other sections though may be able to assist with general course
