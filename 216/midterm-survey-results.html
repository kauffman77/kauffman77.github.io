<li><p>
I wish that the in class lectures were post3d the same
day. Sometimes, I watch them so I can write down things that I might
have missed during lecture; however, the current delay of the
recorded lecture videos kills all momentum for me as I'm pretty busy
and might not have time to watch it the day it's released
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Videos are usually posted within 24 hours of when the lecture was
given. While there are occasional delays on this, "the current delay"
you mentioned does not seem to reflect this pattern.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li>I often walk out of lecture completely lost on the material that we
just went over, but when I look at the labs and projects I find out
that it's way simpler than I thought.</li>
<li><p>
I feel that learning the content and getting a grasp on it in
lecture is relatively easy. The part I struggle with the most is
implementing it in projects
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Learn by doing. We are in a constructive field and most computing
practitioners need to make things: programs, algorithms, analyses,
etc.  Listening someone talk about doing this can give some insight
but there is not substitute for actually doing it yourself. So, just
do it.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li>In class, people ask too many random questions that distract from
the course just for the sake of participation.</li>
<li><p>
I love the interactive nature of the lectures. 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I favor dialogue in our meetings. There is a modest cost to this in
that some students may find the questions asked by others to be
irrelevant. I've not found that to be the case much. Options in the
above numerical results split somewhat on this with about 34% of
students indicating they learn from the questions of others and 24%
indicating they find student questions detract from the
discussion. I'll always do my best to keep the presentation on track
but questions from students are an important way to broaden and deepen
the topics we discuss so I'll continue to field them frequently.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
Lectures feel a bit slow and it's working better for me to learn
almost all the material from the labs/hws/projects.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Choose your own adventure: if it works better for you to skip lecture,
by all means do so. We've set up what we hope is a rich set of
resources and it's fully expected that different students will
gravitate towards the coursework they feel helps them the most.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li>The main thing that I struggle with for this class is the fact that
lectures go over a ton of ways to transform binary etc and don't
spend a lot of time going through how to find bugs and memory
problems.</li>
<li><p>
I'm struggling with interpreting Valgrind errors still&#x2026;
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I've been meaning to do a Debugging video to talk in more detail about
tactics to debug C programs. I'll take this as more motivation to do
so. We did discuss Valgrind basics early on but many students could
probably benefit from a longer, optional treatment.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
Sometimes I hear people around me telling each other which questions
to ask so that they all get the point
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I'll ask about this on the end of the semester survey. I don't
believe the "EP farming" strategy to be that wide-spread but I'm
curious about it.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li>Lecture notes are a little hard to follow at times because there are
large amounts of text to read.</li>
<li><p>
I don't really know if I should take notes during lecture because
the slides are very detailed already.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I am guilty of plopping down lots of text on my slides. From a
strict presentation standpoint, this is a no-no. However, I learned
early in my teaching career that my slides are NOT just used for
presentations and are rather a study tool students use for a variety
of things including out-of-class review. Making them reasonably
self-contained with more dense information became more important
after realizing this. Re-explaining something in one's own words via
notes is ALWAYS a good idea. The act of formulating and writing such
notes will help to internalize the information even if you never
look at the notes again.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I think I struggle sometimes with not jumping around in
projects/assignments, which sometimes isn't an effective way to work
through them.</li>

<li>I find that a few of the project and lab coding problems require
very little thought and understanding as the pseudo-code logic is
given or the you only need to copy a past template. Having more
options for the less directed coding problems (like the dynamic
memory allocation for slurp<sub>file</sub> in p1) might be benefitial</li>
<li>Assignments and gives little room to experiment and experience
solving a problem on my own</li>
<li><p>
I loved the helpful comments that were provided in the project
descriptions of each method that we had to implement. In fact, it
provided guidance, and I did not have to wait hours on OH for a
small problem or misunderstanding to get fix allowing me to save
time.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We'll try to incorporate opportunities for "creativity" in projects
where we can. However, to scale the course for ~500 students, there is
a limit to the amount of flexibility in the design of programs that we
can offer.  Keep in mind that your later coursework, particularly
senior electives, will have many opportunities for creativity in the
domains that those courses study. At this level, the general
expectation is students should be exposed to "reasonably good
designs" for programs that they can use going forward. That said,
feel free to re-design programs like Banlet to experiment with
different designs to contrast them to the prescribed version.  This
would be a great way to learn about program design at a higher level

<li>The coding assignment was fair but I waited too long to start it and
was unable to pass all the tests.</li>
<li>I usually need to open labs and projects super early so I can allot
a 1-2 day panic period at the beginning</li>
<li>One thing that I find as a double-edge sword is the linear style in
the projects. Some of the problems force you to have other functions
already completed in order to test if it works. It's good in the
sense that you get an understanding of how a function works prior to
having to call it, but it's bad in the sense that if you are stuck
on a certain problem, you are deadlocked until you can find a TA to
guide you.</li>
<li>I enjoy this course so far, I just need to manage my time better and
not procrastinate.</li>
<li><p>
I think the main thing for me is time management
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Learning time management is the biggest side-lesson that a University
education provides.  Those lessons can be hard but will pay dividends
over your lifetime.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
Demos are quite useless and is usually no better than simply reading
through the website's description which I do wish gave a bit more
direction than simply dumping a project and hoping we figure things
out.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I'm not sure if your beef is with lab demos or the project overview
video.  However, it is apparent that you are dissatisfied.  If you
have some constructive feedback like "it would help if you explained
X" or "demos going over topics more slowly, showing answers, and then
asking for questions on them would be helpful" then we can try to
adjust.  However, your present feedback on how we aren't giving enough
direction is guilty of that as well: you haven't given us enough
direction to help. Feel free to email me if you want to follow up.

<h3 id="orge1c4869">Discussion Sections and Labs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge1c4869">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I would like discussions to become just Q&amp;A sessions the entire
time, sort of like an extra office hours. I feel that the content
discussed in the demos is not as helpful to me as the answers to the
questions I would like to ask the TA.</li>
<li>For discussion: I think it would be helpful if the TAs did MORE
explanation of the labs and then let students work on their
own. It's important because I think a lot of the time we learn new
(coding) concepts in labs so when they're not properly explained it
makes everything harder.</li>
<li><p>
Having multiple TA's during discussion allow students to get better help.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We try to provide a flexible experience in discussions that has a bit
of everything. 83% of students indicated that the current structure
for discussions is working for them so we'll continue it for now.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li>I feel like the labs could correspond a little more to what we learn
in class (though they do a fair amount of time).</li>
<li><p>
Initially, I was very stressed in this course because it took me 3
weeks to realize that your way of teaching is to introduce new
concepts in discussion and then bring them up in lecture. I am not
used to that and it threw me off a lot because my confidence in
coding classes isn't great and I was confused almost all the
time. Later I talked to my TAs and other friends from other
discussions and realized that it's not 'your fault', it's just that
the idea was not executed right.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I am also dissatisfied with how the Labs are just one session ahead of
where lecture is at. Part of this is that the labs were designed for a
course where there was only one discussion meeting per week and it was
always on Wednesday.  I've not had the opportunity to re-think how
this could better work at UMD where we are blessed with 2 meetings per
week BUT one of them happens before lecture meets. Likely that will be
a summer task that takes effect next fall. Sorry for the modest
dis-coordination that this has caused for the present semester.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
One big thing that i would like is if the TAs posted the slides that
had information on it
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We can do that. I'll have TAs start uploading slides/materials they
use to a publicly shared Google drive that is available to students.

<h3 id="org707034e">A bit of GRACE</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org707034e">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Learning the grace environment was difficult in the first one/two
weeks and I largely figured it out through trial and error, but at
this point in the course, I don't have any concerns!</li>

<li>Another slight annoyance I have is that grace is really annoying to
use especially when it comes to projects because its not intuitive
to use and its pretty slow.</li>

<li>Working with remote servers so often, like Grace, is something that
I've gotten used to and can do, but it's very tedious to work with,
where I have to spend around 3-4 mins every time I want to work on
216 just to get my environment set up. I understand that you guys
can't really change that, but that's ok.</li>

<li>&#x2026; running into issues on macOS Xquartz that can make the coding
process slightly more difficult.</li>

<li>I was initially struggling with coding on xQuartz due to its low
refresh rate as we scroll, however, as I've switched I've found
VScode to be extremely useful in making the coding much easier.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
The consensus among students and staff is that GRACE is not great as
login servers go and should be upgraded. Kauffman will keep on that in
the long run.
</p>

<p>
In the short run, many students have found it more pleasant to work
with GRACE by setting up VS Code with the SFTP extension. Have a look
there if you are struggling with your current remote editing setup.

<h3 id="orgb567435">The C Language</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb567435">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I think the new C language is just a little daunting.</li>
<li>C is also pretty neat, memory management can be difficult but is a new thing to debug</li>
<li>Pointers seem like they should confusing and hard to wrap my head
around as well as C syntax but I think I am getting it really well.</li>
<li>I don't know how to get C code to run if I didn't start from an
existing project/lab file. Maybe that's a problem.</li>
<li>I struggled a bit understanding C, the syntax is very similar to
java so it was forgiving in that aspect but&#x2026;</li>
<li>I am still trying to get used to C programming. It's very different
from Java and there is a lot of syntax that I still need to learn and
remember.</li>
<li>Realized during the test that I didn't actually know what to do to
make and run my own C file</li>
<li>C is rather annoying to code in&#x2026;</li>
<li>I am struggling a bit with having to worry about memory compared to
in Java where I didn't really have to worry about it, but I am
getting used to it.</li>
<li>Coming into this class with no C background makes it difficult to
gauge if I am prepared for the projects or not.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
Exposure to C will make you a better programmer. You'll start to see
as you code in Java "oh, this is a memory allocation, this is actually
a pointer, this will be in the Stack and this in the Heap, etc."  So
too with all other languages.  Getting used to C and what has come
after it (Lisp, Java, Python, OCaml, Rust, etc.) will give you
perspective and allow you to select the right tool (programming
language) for the job. But, it does take time to learn the tool and
its quirks.

<h3 id="org9da045c">Potpourri</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9da045c">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Since I've had some previous exposure to concepts introduced in this
class, like how memory works, binary representations of data, text
encodings, and files, I've had a fairly easy time grasping the
material taught in class, and C hasn't proved too difficult either.</li>
<li>For some reason always feel like most students are already pros at
this stuff while I am just being introduced to these things for the
first time.</li>
<li><p>
I'm not fully comfortable navigating UNIX or creating programs that
utilize the command line yet.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A large class like this one will have student with a wide range of
backgrounds. Some will have significant experience with many of the
concepts, others none. DO NOT LET THIS INTIMIDATE YOU.  This course is
designed to expose everyone to low-level systems and supposed "pros"
are likely those that have done some of this before. Just keep walking
your own path and you'll make progress. There are a lot of things to
learn in a course like this so absorb what you can knowing that
these things will be around for your entire career and you can
always round back to them.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
I think it I necessary to have grades and feedback as soon as
possible within the course, not to be weeks in with assignments done
and no grades or understanding of where I am at as far as
grade/feedback.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Grades for HWs and Labs are available immediately. I'm not sure how
much faster we can get.  Project tests results are also available
immediately.  Project manual inspection and grades are now available
at the beginning of Week 7 of the course. If you are concerned about
your standing in the course, use the posted grade calculator to
tabulate or email Prof Kauffman to talk it over.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
The introduction of file reading, command line, and other dynamic
user input that is very different from object orientated to be
pretty difficult to wrap my head around
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
While there may be some surface syntax differences, file I/O looks
about the same in all languages. A good demo of this would be to port
Banlet to Java or Python. You'll see that there are the same basic
"get stuff from this file" calls there though they'll likely return
you a String instead in those contexts.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
I am worried that although I am learning lots about coding in C, a
lot of it is looking up syntax and logic from the web or class notes
while I'm doing the exercises, so I'm worried I'm not memorizing a
lot of the weird syntax and I would not be able to do it without web
assistance.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It feels weird now, but another few months and it will feel normal. In
that time you'll go from looking things up frequently, to less
frequently, to rarely.  That is the pattern of learning anything,
whether it's your lines in a play, how kick a ball, or the fingerings
for notes on a violin. Keep practicing and you'll own it eventually.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li>I also appreciate the fast response times on piazza. It makes it
much easier to work on projects when I don't have to wait to have
clarifying answers questioned.</li>
<li>Everything is there, it just depends on how much time I put into
the class myself.</li>
<li>I also love the office hours as I have been to the professor's
office hours</li>
<li><p>
I think the course is going well overall because there is a lot of
help.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Course staff are working very hard and we're glad that students are
feeling that. We all want you to learn and are striving towards that
goal.
