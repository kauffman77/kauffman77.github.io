<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I'm struggling with balancing this class in combination with my
other rigorous courses, though; this is more of an issue regarding
mytime management.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Time management is the most important and longest-serving lesson
you'll learn in college. It is not taught in classes but is worth
investigating on your own as it will pay great dividends in the long
run.  Keep on struggling and if you figure it out, let me know as I'm
still working on this skill myself.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>CS is tough, and I know I am not the only one who is struggling, but
near me, everyone seems to be prepared, but I am not, so sometimes,
it is about winning mentality.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Don't get fooled: it's easy for folks to <i>seem</i> more competent but you
don't see their struggle, either now or in the past when they learned
some of these things earlier than you. CS is infamous for its
disparity of experience levels with some students having exposure to
computing since their tweens and some only starting in college. The
"winning mentality" you alluded to is entirely personal: are you
interested in what you are studying and do you enjoy what you are
doing? If so, keep at it - that's far more important than comparisons
to others.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I have not been cracking the textbook yet and I will when getting
into it when the assembly portion rolls around but it seems dense
for me.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
That sounds like a good policy. If you're unfamiliar with caches,
virtual memory, linking, system calls, and other topics we'll cover,
Bryant and O'Hallaron's textbook will also prove useful as an expert
resource on those things.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I think C was easier to learn than I thought. I didn't realize how
similar it was to Java.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Most of Java was copied from C and arranged to make the transition
from C to Java palatable. I'm glad that design is making your
transition in the other direction somewhat easier.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This class is stressful compared to 132</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
I expect CMSC330 will be more stressful than this and all 4xx courses
more stressful than that. Things get harder but you'll be stronger in
each case to meet that challenge.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I feel that I should be reviewing the content more on my own each
day outside of class. Doing a bit of extra work each day will reduce
stress by quite a lot come next exam time, so I will definitely
improve upon that starting this week.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
That's a great plan. Daily effort leads to improvement. We laud those
that lift or run or practice their instrument every day as we know
implicitly that in 6 months they'll be better at those things. We
laugh at someone proposing to lift weights for 18 hours to get strong
by the next day. Academic study is no different. So practice daily.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I feel lost and I don't know why</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Find someone to talk to about it. I'm available, email me to set up an
appointment. Don't stay lost. Get help from staff. Make some effort to
find your way.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I feel like the lectures and discussions are working well in my
understanding but thats after i do some research on my own. I would
like some more code demonstration like code made from scratch so I
can watch along as its being made that makes it easier to follow and
understand.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Our time is limited. I'm sorry that the presentations in lecture and
discussion are not wholly satisfying. You should know that the general
expectation is that EVERYONE will need to do some studying and
practice on their own. It's a common misconception that a student can
just sit in meetings and become capable. Keep coding on your own to
get practice and you'll become very capable indeed.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I'm lucky that I have some experience with C, as I have a feeling
this class would quite difficult if I didn't.</li>
<li>I think overall the pace of this class is good and fair to people
with little to no experience with C.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
This course is geared towards folks who have programmed but no
in C. Glad to hear that for at least some folks, that tuning is on
pitch. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I think the OH are the best resource to the course. All the TAs are
so helpful and work diligently with the students.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Glad to hear it.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I am frustrated with the availability of office hours. I have not
attended any because they all end before 4pm and that is times where
most people have classes. I am booked completely during those hours
which makes it impossible to get help at office hours.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Sorry that TA office hours are not working out for you. From your
comments, your full schedule would indeed interfere with attending
office hours. That's the price of doing a lot: others won't
necessarily have compatible schedules for you. Attend your discussion
section and get help there as you are able.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I have forgotten the prerequisites a bit and i'm a little behind and
i don't know what to do i'm scared</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
That is a concern as we expect folks have 1 year of college-level
programming experience. This course will be difficult without
that. Make an appointment to see me about how to proceed and perhaps
we can address some of your fears.
</p>
</blockquote>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I'm struggling whether or not computer science as a whole is right
for me. I keep seeing people have a much firmer understanding of
these subjects and it makes me doubt myself constantly. I don't know
if I could do it without the guidance of others.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
If you enjoy what you are doing, keep at it.  You're paying some
tuition to get the assistance of teachers and staff to educate
you. That money is intended to make it faster to learn than what you
could do with just library card. Lean on your teachers to help you get
better. That's our job and most of us want to help.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I really appreciate all of the regular practice we receive (Homework
Quizzes and Questions, Labs, etc.) and find that they are helping
drive home concepts we discuss in lecture, allowing for low-stakes,
hands-on practice. However, I feel that these are perhaps more
necessary for me then they should be.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Practice is necessary for everyone.  Don't doubt it, just do it. I'm
glad the practice we provide is helping you learn.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Most of my learning occurs on my own time through practice and
study. This isn't necessarily a new thing for me in the CS program,
but it would be nice to come out of lecture feeling a bit more
confident in my understanding and retention of the new material
(more explanatory slides, more time devoted to new concepts,
lower-level explanations, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Different tactics work for different folks. It is important that you
figure out what works for you as no one else can. The course structure
is meant to provide a variety of different mechanisms by which
students can learn content so as to enable the most possible students
to achieve competence.  If certain activities don't do as much for
you, minimize the time you spend on them. Continue to do what you find
helps you improve.

<li>I think the virtual environment provides a bit of
inconvenience/learning to use that makes it a little more difficult
to test code than directly on a code editor.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
There's not too much "virtual" about our environment. You connect to a
machine (GRACE), that machine has a compiler, you compile and run your
code there.  Java's "virtual machine" (JVM) is somewhat more virtual
than GRACE in that regard.  Code editors don't compile and run
code. You need a compiler and a computer to run compiled code. I'd
hope that's clear by now in the course.  I admit that the remote
aspect of GRACe is somewhat less direct than being able to use your
own local system for development. Consider looking at alternatives
that would enable local development if that's too off-putting. You'd
likely learn a few things along the way on setting this up and become
more capable on account of it. Or just get the most of learning to do
remote development, an important industry skill.

<p>
You and me both. I've been pestering the GRACE admins for two years
about how we can make this easier. They've yet to do much to
help. GRACE is the only server I've encountered that lacks any
facility to automate at least some parts of the login. You can turn on
a VPN to UMD's global connect and this bypasses the 2-factor portion
of login but you'll still need to type your password in.

<p>
Weigh in at the end of the semester to let us know if this works out
alright for the assembly coding we're now on about. As long as the VMs
used by Codespaces are run on x86-64 hardware machines, probably all
will be well. However, the reason I've not gotten a Docker solution to
work for CMSC216 is that when you run a VM on ARM systems, things get
funky with a different assembly language.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>TA's running through the whole lab would be a huge benefit, I often
find small bugs/errors and I wish I had some help. I would still
learn it but it would be in a more teach-able way.</li>
<li>I think the in person lab demos should be even shorter like 5 - 10
mins unless you plan to take out the lab demo vids. more time for
questions and independent work is best.</li>
<li>I would rather have the entire discussion time dedicated to the lab,
or the entire time being a walkthrough, as splitting time is a
little bit inefficient in my opinion.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Opinions on time allocation within the discussion sections varies. A
multiple choice part of the survey asked about this and the largest
fraction of students (68%) indicated that the current structure of
discussions works well enough and should be continued. Sorry that
doesn't please those commenting above but they say the sign of a good
compromise is that no one is entirely happy.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I think the questions on the labs are very frustrating especially
when it feels like I have the all correct, but I am missing some
questions. I do not know which question I have in correct and there
is no good way to guess and check.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Seven or so folks mentioned this in free-form feedback, that
completing Lab QUIZ questions is hard as it's an all-or-nothing affair
with no guidance on what might be wrong. I'll think on how we might
modify this BUT the intention is that the QUIZ is a bit harder and
requires you to really know what's happening.  Staff are under
instructions to help students work through these issues when they
arise so don't be afraid to ask for help.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I think that the TA's should go over the questions either during
discussions or they should go over them in the videos.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
I'll mention this to TAs who record videos as it may indeed provide
the escape hatch that students struggling with lab QUIZ questions are
looking for.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>While I HATE going to my 8am discussion because it's so damn early,
I still find the discussions so useful that I go to them
anyways. This is because the TAs give you so much help with the labs
during discussion that it genuinely saves me a lot of time on those
assignments. The fact that I am willing to power through an 8am
discussion (that has optional attendance) out of all things means
that you guys are doing something right with discussions.</li>
</ul>

<p>
High compliments that I'll relay to the 8am TAs.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is minor problem of mine but the way the seats are arranged in
the discussion sections room is quite awkward. I'd prefer a screen
at the front and everyone looking straight with the desks arranged
linearly. Half the time I can't tell if someone is staring into my
soul or look into the screens behind me.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
I find the arrangement in IRB discussion rooms also to be
disorienting. Some TAs in the past have expressed preference for AVW
rooms which are more lecture-style with a single screen up front.
Unfortunately there's not much that can be done about it at the
moment. Try to find a seat that focuses your attention on a single
screen.

If you have to earn it, it's not free. However, I get your sentiment,
that the incentives to do Labs/HWs match well with the benefit you get
from them.

<li>These past review sessions were super helpful I would love if we
had warm up questions like them in disscussion at least once a week.</li>

increasing the rigor of Labs somewhat but there may yet be some space
for "warmup" questions in discussion.

<p>
Come see me. Make an appointment and I'll attempt to provide

the practice exams were "way easier" than the actual exam.  We'd need

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org15764cf">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I don't like how most of lecture is spent answering questions. I
feel like I'm not actually learning as much since students are
compelled to ask questions for a grade.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
False.  Most of lecture is me talking, asking students questions, and
providing exercises.  Students have questions sometimes and I answer
them. When students ask irrelevant questions, I say as much and we
move away from that quickly.  However most questions I field are very
reasonable and deserving of the small amount of bonus credit they are
awarded as they enrich the conversation we have in lecture.
</p>

<p>
I'm sorry that you don't share the same questions. That is one
disadvantage of being in a large course: yours are not the only
desires that get consideration. There are several alternatives
including skipping lecture and watching the videos which would allow
you to quickly bypass question from others. You might also leave the
university and hire a private one-on-one tutor who will move at your
pace sparing you the need to deal at all with other people's
questions.  I'll caution you that both these will rob you of
opportunities practicing patience and curiosity, two skills that are
universally powerful. A third alternative might be to form your own
questions and ask them in lecture. That'll earn you some bonus credit
and contribute to the conversation.
</p>

<p>
Forming questions while you listen is an OUTSTANDING way to test
whether you're properly engaging with the discussion or are just a
passive observer. Even if my response to a "dumb" question is "I
covered what you just asked 5 minutes ago" informs the asker (and
everyone around them) that their attention lapsed. A diligent student
receiving such a response will practice focusing more
thoroughly. Aside from that type of question, I rarely get "dumb"
questions, just inquiries that help to clarify which is valuable for
everyone. 
</p>

<p>
In spring 2025, I asked students in an anonymous poll like this one
whether they asked questions in lecture due to curiosity or solely
because they could earn points. Of 317 respondents, 3 said they
frequently asked just to get points. That is price I am willing to pay
as it enabled a culture of inquiry where many times that number of
students asked questions out of curiosity. If that bugs you, so be it.
This is my operation to run and I like dialogue.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>People could argue that people ask questions just for engagement
points but at the same time ive found myself, because asking
questions is encouraged with a little bit of bonus credit, asking
genuine questions that i have but would not have asked otherwise
because it's awkward/embarrassing with the thought of "i'll figure
it out on my own" but never really do.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Glad to hear the incentive structure is doing its job. Keep
asking. Stay curious.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I would appreciate it if the question was always repeated out loud
to the audience. I find I can't hear people a lot of the time and
spend the first 30 seconds of a question's answer reverse
engineering what they asked.</li>

I often forget to repeat questions. Thanks for the reminder to do so
as I know lots of folks can't hear what students in other parts of the

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Additionally, in CMSC131 and 132, my professor would give a 2 minute
break halfway through the lecture, which I thought helped me
maintain focus for the entire lecture. Because lectures for 216 are
longer, I think that a 2 minute break mid-lecture would be helpful.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
That's nice of your past instructors but I'm afraid not something I'm
willing to do.  If you need a break, take one. My expectation is that
the natural breaks to work on exercises should be enough for folks to
stay focused for 75 minutes.

</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I believe I don't get enough out of coding lectures. I find it hard
to concentrate and do go on my phone and get distracted which is a
me problem.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
It is a "me problem" as you put it. It is mature of you to recognize
it as such. I try to do some coding here and there but there are lots
other things we need to discuss. Try to find ways to refresh your
focus. Yours is the generation that us older folks most fear can't pay
attention to anything for more than 6 seconds. Prove us wrong. Try, as
you listen, to formulate a question about what's being discussed: what
are the limits, the special cases, the situations where things might
be different. If you hone your imagination to play internally with the
model of what's being constructed, you won't need the speaker to be
completely entertaining as you can mentally augment their discourse
with your own accouterments. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I enjoy the extra credit, but I feel that the log2 system, while
good at the beginning, slowly tapers off and makes it feel less
rewarding to ask/answer questions. While I'm sure it is important to
make sure people can't farm a ton of extra credit, I think changing
the formula in some ways could make it more encouraging, even if
people get an extra point or two.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Afraid not. "Diminishing returns" are there so as not to skew things
too badly away from doing the actual coursework. An alternative is to
simply cap the bonus at a certain point but I like logarithms better.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I have trouble paying attention in lecture, maybe it's cause I've
trained myself to consume content at 2x speed that 1x isn't cutting
it anymore. Watching the lecture videos on my own time helps me a
lot and it's easier to not get distracted by my computer or phone or
whatever.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
See above. I understand that natural speaking speed may be too slow in
some cases but listening patiently is a good skill to develop. Try
going at normal speed from time to time at least to practice this.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I also think it would be cool if a few minutes were spent talking
about real-world examples of how the stuff we're learning in class
would be used. For example, in CMSC132, the professor mentioned that
stacks can be used for implementing the undo/redo functionality in
text documents and it made it more interesting.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
We delve into applications hear and there but generally at this stage,
they are still somewhat far away. Stacks can be useful for undo/redo
but you need two of them along with a way to encode what is being
done/undone and the data that manipulates it.  I taught a course years
ago that implemented this in a limited setting and students were
surprised by how much more needed to happen aside from the stacks
involved to enable this kind of functionality. Great practice for
coders but it's not something that I'd expect of students in a 1xx or
2xx course, more a 3xx or 4xx course. Come see me if you want some
insight on it. 
</p>

<p>
As our course continues, you might see some more applications. Pay
attention to Projects as they are ALL applications and reminiscent of
a "real world" program.

If folks have specific criticisms of parts of the project they think

practice figuring out what to do based on nebulous client input is a
great software engineering skill.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One thing I'll note is I feel the project, while very comprehensive,
feels a little strict with the implementation. It felt like there
was only one very specific way to approach the function
implementations. I think for future projects there should be a lot
less strict implementation details, since that led to some problems
like the issue with the rounding in the plot/multiplot.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
This project is particularly strict with some of the numerics as I've
had trouble in past semesters and this one with the floating point
rounding and don't want students to get too pinched by it.  The
general character of my projects in these large classes is that there 
is a design that we thrust on students and not much room to deviate
from it. Don't expect that to change much for future projects in the
course. That choice addresses my primary concerns:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>We have certain learning goals and to ensure those are exposed in
projects, the design is constrained.</li>
<li>We have a LOT of students so some amount of automatic grading and a
pattern for manual grading is necessary to handle the volume ruling
out free-form designs.</li>
<li>I don't expect students to be able to design things at this stage
in their career. Rather, they should be studying simple designs of
more experienced folks so that they learn some basic patterns.</li>
</ol>

<p>
I'd encourage you to take this project and extend it
yourself. Consider a different design, build on the multiplotting,
allowing for horizontal vs vertical printing, the sky's the
limit. That will allow you to explore and learn and potentially
scratch the creative itch you developed here. Also, interviewers love
it when you have your own projects rather than just what you've been
forced to do through coursework.
