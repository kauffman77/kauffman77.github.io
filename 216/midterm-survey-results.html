<li>I feel I am doing well with understanding material but I constantly
forget little things like the byte size of ints, chars, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Practice makes perfect. Look it up, forget it, look it up, forget it,
look it up&#x2026; then you start to remember.

<li>I haven't needed to read the textbook yet, but I heard from
TA's/upperclassmen that for the assembly portion I should really
start.</li>
<li>I find the textbook to be very dense and hard to read.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
It's advisable to read but reading dense content is work: go slowly,
take notes, re-read, absorb. Give yourself time to do so as
generations of learners have before you.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When I go to lectures I feel that I am able to understand the
concepts, but when I start working on my own, I feel lost.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
That's natural: when I go to a ballet, I think I can dance. It's only
when you try for yourself do you find how much effort it takes to make
those moves so fluid.  Don't let that dissuade you: get lost then get
unlost as I did for years. After a while, you'll be able to guide
others like I do now.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I just don't know how to approach this class even though we are more
than a month in the course now, but it is taking me a lot of time to
figure things out.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
That probably means you're learning.  We've got labs, HWs, projects,
textbook readings, lecture slides and recordings, and office
hours. Grab onto something, read, try ask for guidance from staff, and
stay determined.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I'm not sure under what circumstances it is appropriate to ask for
help from Professor Kauffman vs. TAs (e.g. asking questions specific
to class content vs. those that extend beyond the course material,
help with projects, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Sorry for your confusion. You can ask me for help on coursework or
general questions about computing and life. I believe that's true for
TAs as well. Office hours are open for inquiry. I'm not sure what
policies other course institute but I'd hope that most of your
teachers are willing to talk freely about topics of interest.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I'm really really trying hard to succeed, but it just feels like
anything that I do isn't clicking. It feels like everyone else is
ahead while i'm lagging behind. I don't know where i'm going wrong,
but I felt that this was the only place I can really say
that. Thanks for listening.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Perhaps you are the dead last person in the course right now in terms
of understanding but that seems unlikely: the dead last person isn't
concerned enough about this course to write thoughtfully about
it as you have. As ever, my first advice is to stay determined:
tenacity trumps talent in almost every setting and just refusing to
give up will likely see you through the course. I'd also suggest
coming to see me or another staff member you trust to get counsel. We
can give you some perspective on whether you have truly have some
deficits in understanding to surmount or instead are mis-perceiving
that and can relax a bit. If we discover deficits, we can also give
you guidance on efficient means to patch you gaps in
understanding. You're paying a pretty penny for your education and
guidance like this is part of the package.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I know that the more time I spend on this course, the more I
know. However, is there any benchmark about what should I must know
and what is the more advance information?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
That is the highest complement you can give a course: when I invest
effort, I gain returns in improved understanding and applicable
skills.  Don't concern yourself overly about "benchmarks" aside from
the usual (get reasonable scores on assignments).  If you are curious
about more advanced topics, come see me (Prof K) in office hours. Once
I understand your interests, I can usually direct you towards sources
on that will satisfy your curiosity.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I find myself spending a lot of time just reading the directions,
watching the videos, and just staring at the code to fully
understand what I am supposed to do. After I feel like I fully
understand what I have to do, actually writing the code is pretty
easy.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
I heard Rich Hickey (author of Clojure and a personal hero of mine)
characterize this as "hammock-driven development", a jab at
test-driven development, agile development, and myriad other modes
that coders advocate for doing. Hickey's approach: think about what
you actually need to do, think some more, read about it, understand
the problem, feel it in your bones, AND THEN start coding.  It tends
to work better. You might poke a bit with code but only beginners sit
down and start blurting program lines without a clear picture of how
they'll fit together. Keep doing what you're doing because it sounds
like the right approach, especially for you.
</p>
</blockquote>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I think a lot of students would appreciate posting certain things
early, whether it be assignments, instructions, projects, etc. I
don't think it should be expected that these things are posted
early, but I also think doing so is strictly beneficial. For
students who want to get ahead, they can look ahead (but maybe not
submit until a certain date if its an assignment), and for students
who just want to stay on track, they can simply follow the standard
dates that go along with the lectures. For example, you could post
some instructions or guides on the assembly language we will be
using later in the semester early.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
I've posted our course schedule along with the associated readings in
our required textbook for the entire semester. Consider reading ahead
if you are so inclined.

<li>Special thanks to the TA's for all your hard work and effort to
help us succeed.</li>

Amen.

this is the first one to put me out of my comfort zone, but that's

<li>I do wish it was easier to quickly run C code, perhaps locally, via
some sort of super quick and light-weight set-up, like if I wanted
to test some syntax or even use C in the future to test some math
thing I come across. I know I can get this working with the skills
I've learned in this class, but it kinda sucks that, in taking a
C-programming course, I'm only really familiar running C code
specifically via VSCode + UMD's Grace.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
There are some ways. On Windows, try the Windows Subsystem for Linux
(WSL). This will give an experience almost identical to Grace but
local. On MacOS, I can turn you to some approaches involving Docker
which will largely work but not as regularly. We've iterated several
times with environment and the best approach we've come up with for
(1) providing students a Linux environment, (2) making the setup short
and easy, and (3) having a uniform approach for all students (Windows,
Mac, Linux, Other) is the one we're on.  From the graphs above it
seems 90% of students are able to log manage with Grace with another
4% on other usable platforms. I'll call that a win on most days.

<p>
Test cases are quite another matter. I'll consider having an optional
meeting if students are interested in learning to write their own
tests. However, compared to Java/OCaml/Python/Others there is little
uniformity on how C code tests are set up. We have a system that works
for the course but is generally not used anywhere else. I find it
hard to believe students know how to write test cases when most
classes that "teach" writing tests simply require students to write
them for projects but spend 0 time on HOW to write tests well. That
stems from the fact that most teachers don't know how to write test
cases in the first place. I'm not claiming I write particularly good
tests but after spending 10 years writing tests for students in
Java/OCaml/C/Python, I know what works in a classroom setting.

are discussed in more detail in Lecture on Tuesday/Thursday.  To that
end, it might be better if labs met Wed/Fri, but we play the hand
we're dealt.  Don't let the dissuade you: if parts of a lab are
confusing, come to lecture prepared with questions. Then finish the
lab later in the week when you have those doubts resolved.

<p>
To take this feedback seriously, I'd need to discuss in detail what
exactly the commented has in mind as "questionable": all the exam
questions were carefully created to help staff to determine whether
students have absorbed specific knowledge and skills and can act
accordingly. If you'd like to discuss the purpose each question serves
to do so, come see me in office hours and I'll explain.

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Opinions seem to vary on this but the practice exam represented the
style, content, and difficulty level of the actual exam.  The
questions are different and the sentiment that practice exams are
easier most frequently comes from the fact that there's no pressure
and answers are freely given. Things always seem easier in those
situations.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>While I think anything that can be logically extrapolated from
content in lecture, projects or in the labs is fair game, some of
the midterm questions like the null terminator character question
were difficult to derive from what was taught in class. In that
situation, students who have prior experience or more general domain
knowledge had a significant leg up. In my opinion, exams in a course
should test the ability of the student to understand and display
knowledge of what has been taught in the course, not external
knowledge of the subject.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
I reject this assertion.  We discussed string layout at length
including null termination of strings. We discussed ASCII coding
conventions and that bits can represent most anything so long as the
coding scheme for how to interpret them is known. We discussed how
arrays do not carry their length in C and that only strings use a
sentinel value to terminate arrays.  Students who paid attention had
everything in hand they needed to solve that exam problem. Prior
experience is always helpful in any endeavor but to conclude that the
question unfairly tested "external knowledge" is a bad
misunderstanding of how the course progressed.

</ul>

<p>
When I started teaching, my slides were sparse and students complained
that there was not enough information on them. Those students
indicated that when they reviewed the slides, they didn't make any
sense.  That approach follows the principle that slides are meant as a
presentation aid and are NOT a stand-alone artifact of much use.
</p>

<p>
I've adjusted my approach over the years and included more detail in
slides as students largely want that detail in their review. A slicker
approach would be to have separate Slides and Course Notes but I'm
lazy and don't feel like maintaining two mostly overlapping documents.
</p>

<p>
If you don't like looking at the slides, then listen to me. Taking
your own notes is a good idea; perhaps just try paraphrasing some of
the material or constructing a code example which complements those

<p>
False. The course is progressing at a normal pace and we are pretty

Niche questions are fine as long as they are on topic. When I detect
attempts to "farm" engagement points, I shut them down. Generally,
though, most folks ask relevant and well-intentioned questions from my

the price of having a group of learners served by and individual

Why 5? Why not 2 or 0? If you know the answers to all the questions,
pat yourself on the head as its an affirmation that you're tracking

might learn something.  I limit questions when there is need but when
we have time, questions are useful for affirmation and expansion.

back and look at the code) were told to be unnecessary and, in fact,
likely make me lose points.</li>

<p>
Comments are like any human writing: their utility and necessity is
highly dependent on the reader. The comments you'd write in this class
are not those that you'd write in an industrial job and the comments
you'd write in one job (front end Javascript dev) are quite different
from another (Linux Kernel dev in C). The audiences are different with
varying knowledge and expectations.

<p>
I'm sorry that you got dinged for "unnecessary" comments. In a
learning setting like this, I advise staff to apply such penalties
only for cases like

<pre class="example">
int x = 5; // assign 5 to x

<li>I understand why project 1 was structured as it was, but that didn't

<blockquote>
<p>
Interesting takes. If you have concrete suggestions on how to
structure the code required for Project 1 so that the it solves the
same problem and requires implementers to demonstrate the same
techniques, by all means share.  I don't enjoy redundancies any more
than the next person and would prefer not to thrust them on students.
I'm happy to discuss this in office hours.
</p>

<p>
If, however, after some thought you can't come up with a way to
tighten up the project because all the elements you thought were
"boring" and "redundant" turned out to be necessary, then you you'll
be where I was when I designed the project.
</p>

<p>
I've yet to have a student whose leveled such judgments come up with
major improvements to projects.  Mostly it's folks who may have
written some of their own programs but never had to describe a project
that hundreds of others will implement and provide support for them
through test cases, documentation, and in-person help.  When you've
done that for a few years, I'll take your criticism to heart. Until
then, such commentary lacks the nuance needed to sway me and screams
of inexperience about how even simple things takes a lot of code.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Throughout the project, it also felt like I was writing arbitrary
functions without knowing how they all connected together. Even
after having completed the entire project and finishing all test
cases, I wouldn't be able to trace out what functions call each
other by memory, as I usually can for other projects.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
This is a concern.  It is true that the project had a strong outline
of what is to be done so students were not required to "design"
anything. This is for two reasons: (1) keeping the whole class
together is helpful for testing and staff assistance AND (2) generally
students are not mature enough to design such a project "well" and
should still be exposed to reasonable examples of design by others.
</p>

<p>
That said, you've identified a gap in your understanding: how do the
pieces of the project fit together. While we are beyond project 1, I
recommend that you spend some time contemplating how the pieces fit
together. You might try designing your own version of the program from
scratch: abandon my design except for the file format and write code
to just solve the problem.  This is actually easier as you're not
concerned about decomposing the project into digestible chunks for
students new to C. I imagine the design will include all the same
pieces with fewer functions that can be individually tested.  By
comparing your own completed design to mine, you'll gain insight into
how the project works and why I subdivided in the way presented.
</p>

<p>
Understanding how the pieces of this and other projects fit together
is an important part of designing programs. When you get into the
wild, you'll rarely design things from scratch but rather be thrust
into an existing, often gargantuan, code base and spend much of your
job getting acquainted with how things fit together. Practicing
that now is a great way to get a leg up.
