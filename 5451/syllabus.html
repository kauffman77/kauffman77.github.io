Students are presumed to have significant experience writing and
debugging programs along with some background in basic computer
systems architecture such as what is offered through CSCI 2021 and
CSCI 4061.  Programming assignments will be in the C programming
language and students without prior experience working with C programs
will be at a major disadvantage.

<h3 id="org6556bbb"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Student Learning Outcomes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
This course focuses on parallel computing, the art of using multiple
processing units to solve computational problems.  The primary goal of
this effort is either to solve a problem in a shorter time than is
possible with a single computer or use the same amount of time to
solve a larger problem.  The course will primarily focus on tightly
coupled parallel computers which have a relatively low overhead to
communicate in contrast to networked computers in which communication
time is high.  
</p>

<p>
Typical topics covered in the course include the following:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Basic parallel computing architecture</li>
<li>Shared and distributed memory computers</li>
<li>POSIX Threads and OpenMP for shared memory computers</li>
<li>MPI: Message Passing Interface for distributed memory computers</li>
<li>CUDA for GPU/Co-processor programming</li>
<li>Common communication patterns in parallel programs</li>
<li>Parallel algorithms for matrix operations, sorting, graphs, and
discrete optimization</li>
<li>Evaluation metrics for parallel computing including speedup,
efficiency, and isoefficiency</li>
<li>Emerging technologies such as parallel programming languages and
supercomputing architectures</li>
</ul>

<p>
As a <b>Learning Outcome</b> of this class, a passing student will be able to carry
out the following types of activities:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Describe the differences, advantages, and limitations of various
parallel computer hardware architectures.</li>
<li>Convert an existing serial program into a parallel version
accounting for coordination, load balancing, and efficient
communication.</li>
<li>Identify common communication patterns that arise in parallel
programming and how several programming platforms make them
possible.</li>
<li>Implement a parallel programs using distributed memory, shared
memory, and GPU/Co-processor paradigms.</li>
<li>Evaluate the theoretical and actual efficiency of parallel programs
using standard metrics.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The skills to accomplish these outcomes will be built primarily
through in-lecture exercises and completion of out-of class
assignments. Aspects of the assignments are described below and will
comprise a combination of theory, written work, and programming on
parallel systems. We will assess the learning outcomes via a series of
short exams during the semester and a final exam at the end of the
semester.
</p>

<p>
The course will be divided into sections which address each of the
styles of parallel computation which are part of the learning
outcomes. Each section will feature an assignment and related exam
giving students exposure to a variety of technologies for parallel
computing and underscoring the commonalities that exist between them.

It is assumed you will have access to a computer with the ability to
edit, compile, and run Unix programs.  Some university labs provide
this ability; the first week of the course will cover how to set up
your personal environment as well.  If you have difficulty accessing a
suitable environment, contact the course staff.
</p>

<p>
You will need to create a CSE Labs account for use on assignments and
during Discussion. Accounts can be created here:
<a href="https://wwws.cs.umn.edu/account-management/">https://wwws.cs.umn.edu/account-management/</a>
</p>

<p>
Environments to compile and run all parallel programs will be through
the CSE Labs system so it is imperative that students set up their CSE
Labs account and know how to remotely access CSE Labs systems. Some
tactics to do so are described here:

<h4 id="orgf6c7041">How should I contact staff?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf6c7041">
<p>
Here are common situations for students and the best method to use to
contact staff.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
I want to get some real-time assistance with some coursework.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Stop by office online. Locations and times for office hours are listed
on the course Canvas site. Keep in mind that <b>office hours get busy</b>
around project deadlines so there may be a queue to wait in to get help.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
I have a question on an assignment or course content and there
aren't any office hours coming up soon.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Post your question on <b>Piazza</b>; staff members check several times a
day and answer questions there. Make sure to post an <b>answerable
question</b> as described in the Etiquette Piazza post and <b>avoid
publicly posting large portions of your code</b>. 
</p>

<p>
You might also try <b>searching Piazza first</b> to see if someone
already asked your question and received an answer.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
I have a logistics questions such as when something is due, when
something will happen, etc.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Also use <b>Piazza</b> for most of these. If a staff member isn't sure how
to answer the question, they'll give you they're best guess sooner and
ask the Professor to confirm later.  
</p>

<p>
Staff will often use <b>Piazza for Announcements</b> such as upcoming
deadlines or canceled office hours. These announcements will go to
student email so check your UMN account regularly.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
I think some of my work was graded wrong and I want someone to look
at it again.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Gradescope</b> has a "Request Regrade" feature which will be open for
students to use after grades are posted. Using this feature will
notify whoever graded your work to have another look. If you cannot
resolve the issue, your grader will involve the professor.  There
are some exceptions to this:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Homework Quizzes allow you to retake the Quiz to improve your
score. No online Regrade Requests will be available, just retake
the quiz up to the deadline.</li>
<li>Lab Quizzes can only be regraded in Labs/Office Hours up to the
next lab. No online Regrade Requests will be available, visit your
lab or office hours to talk to a staff member about your mistakes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
I need help some one-on-one help and I can't make it to office hours
to talk to a staff about it.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Email</b> one or two of your favorite staff members to see if they can
meet outside of their normal office hours. If you don't have luck in
the first go, try contacting a different staff member including Prof
Kauffman.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
I had a major life event (got sick / family problem / mental health
problem) and I'm wondering how to cope with it and this class.
</p>
<blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>On-time submissions receive no penalties</li>
<li>Submitting 1-24 hours will result in the loss of 10% absolute credit</li>

<p>
There will be a series of 30-minute Mini-Exams through the
semester. These will occur at the end of the lecture on the dates they
occur.  Dates for the Mini-exams appear in the schedule.
</p>

<p>
There will also be a comprehensive Final Exam at the end semester.
Refer to the schedule for dates of the exams.
</p>

<p>
At the time of this writing, Exams will take place during lecture
meetings in the normal lecture location. Any changes to this will be
posted in advance of the exams.
</p>

<p>
All exams are <b>Open Resource Exams:</b> unless otherwise specified you
may use any course content during exams including lecture slides, your
notes, the textbook, editors/compilers/shells, and any code the you
have written or received from course staff.  No communication is
allowed during the exam (no email/texting/chat), and no Internet
searches are allowed (do not "google for answers"). In addition, you
may only use exams from previous versions of this course if you
personally took those exams. If in doubt, ask about specifics before
or during the exam.
</p>

<p>
Missing an exam results in a zero score and make-up exams will be
considered only in situations involving significant life events. Proof
of such circumstances will be required for a make-up to be considered.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-6">
<p>
Most coursework will be graded via <b>Gradescope</b> which features a
<b>Request Regrade Button</b> associated with specific problems and
criteria. This will notify the specific individual responsible grading
about the dispute. Raise regrade requests respectfully and
specifically: mention what you think a grader missed in your answer or
why you feel a deduction was unfair. Keep in mind that graders assign
credit based on what appears on the project and exams, not post-hoc
explanations of answers.
</p>

<p>
If a Student and Grader are not able to resolve a grading issue to the
satisfaction of both, the student can <b>ask the grader to consult the
Professor</b> who will review the dispute and resolve it. Students should
ask their grader to do this, not email the Professor directly.
</p>

<p>
When grades are published, there will generally be a <b>1 week window</b>
in which disputes are considered. Failing to request a regrade in that
time will forfeit further opportunity to contest the grade.

</b>

<p>
Nearly all cheating in programming can be averted by adhering to the
<a href="#org9d88573">PRIME DIRECTIVE</a>. Students may be asked at any time to explain code
or exam solutions they submit.  Inability to do so will be construed
as evidence of misconduct.  More specific guidelines are given below.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
Some coursework is to be done individually, usually programming
Projects and Exams.  For this individual work, the following actions
constitute scholastic misconduct (cheating) and will be reported.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Directly copying someone else's solution to an assessment problem,
including student solutions from a previous semester</li>
<li>Directly copying an answer from some outside source such as the
Internet or friend for a homework problem.</li>
<li>Making use of an Instructor Solution manual to complete problems.</li>
<li>Submitting someone else's work as your own.</li>
<li>Using or sharing Exam materials from another student from past
offerings of this course; you may view your own past copies of exams
but not share them with others.</li>
<li>Paying someone for a solutions to assignments/exams.</li>
<li>Posting solutions to any web site including public posts to our
course web site.</li>
<li>Collaborating or copying the work of others during an exam.</li>
<li>Taking another student's code with or without their consent.</li>
<li>Giving another student one's own code on assignments or exams</li>
<li>Aiding or abetting any of the above.</li>
<li>Witnessing any of the above and failing to report it to an
instructor immediately.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>REMEMBER:</b> Once you give away your code/work, you lose control of
it. This may lead to pain in the following non-obvious cases
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Using a public Github repository to track your code allows anyone to
copy it and submit it as their own.</li>
<li>Sharing code with a classmate "just to help them" may lead to them
submitting it as their own, sharing it with others, or selling it
for profit</li>
<li>Giving someone access to your accounts or devices to help them may
mean that they use your account to steal your work subsequently.</li>
<li>Leaving your work open in a public space may allow someone to take
snapshots of your screen and use it as their own.</li>

Any instance of misconduct that is detected will be referred to the

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
The purpose of this course is to learn about programming and learning
from one another is a great help.  To that end, the following actions
<b>will NOT be considered cheating in this course.</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Collaborating with a partner on Assignments that allow it is
perfectly acceptable. Limit your collaborations to within your
partnership to avoid trouble.</li>
<li>Discussing code at a high level with students other than a partner
is fair so long as no code is shared. Take great care at the point
of directly showing your work to others as your answers are
subsequently out of your own control.</li>
<li>Asking public questions on the course discussion board so long as
limited information about your own solution is included. To convey
details of your solution, use private posts.</li>
<li>Asking any course staff member questions in person or online is
acceptable and encouraged. Staff members may initiate small group
discussions in which collaboration is fine.</li>
<li>Making use of your own code or exam materials which you accumulated
from past semesters of this class is fine. If you are retaking the
course, make sure staff know this so that no misunderstandings
occur.</li>
<li>If you are unsure whether a given collaboration is fair or not, stop
the activity and clear it with your instructor.</li>
</ul>

<p>
At all times keep the <a href="#org9d88573">PRIME DIRECTIVE</a> in mind when studying with other
students.  The above collaborations should be limited to getting
someone over a hurdle, not carrying them across the finish line.
