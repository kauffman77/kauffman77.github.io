staff member holding office hours on Problem 1 supposed to say to a
student who wants to talk about Problem 2?
</p>

<p>
Staff have resolved to hold some independent, non-office hour tutorial
sessions on aspects of the project in the future. This may help in the
way that you are indicating would be appreciated.

I didn't like how &#x2026;  people come in early [to office hours] to say
they'll be back later which makes them a priority when they return
and makes others who are there wait longer.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I agree that the "queue camping" and other tactics some students
utilized to manipulate the system are not acceptable. We will likely
implement policies that prevent this in the future.
</p>

<li><p>
The lines are ridiculous and I should not have to skip my other
classes to spend 4 hours waiting to talk to a TA.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I am afraid that lines for shared resource is a common phenomenon in
life. If you've not been to the DMV, I envy you. However, in
university help from staff is a privilege and also a limited resource.
If you are disappointed by how limited that resource is, write to your
senator/representative to get the department more money to make class
sizes smaller and up the staff-to-student ratio. Until then, be
patient and active as you wait. Speaking of which&#x2026;
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
During unified office hours, I would spend the entire day there,
often over 12 hours (as TAs would stay late and I would come early),
yet in that time, I was likely only helped for about 25 minutes
cumulative. There were multiple times that I sat in office hours for
3+ hours only to get help for 5 minutes because my question was
incredibly basic. Maybe, you give us the ability to spend
engagement points to get access to a VIP line?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"VIP" approaches have been pitched and I'd consider them but it
would be tricky to pull off in a fair way. However, the major
concern I have from this kind of comment is expresses an unhealthy
reliance on staff help.  If a problem can truly be solved in 5
minutes by a staff member, it worries me that a diligent student who
is working on the same problem for 3+ hours is not able to find a
solution on their own. It is especially worrying if this happens
repeatedly in the same day. Staff help is to get students over humps
or rough spots. Staff are not there to answer every small and large
question about every detail.  University education is intended to
instruct students to formulate their on queries and solve their own
problems.  Keep that goal in mind and don't sit on your hands while
waiting. Re-read the project specification, review labs, experiment,
use internet searches to help identify the meaning of error
messages, and be active. My favorite office hours encounter is "Oh,
I actually solved that myself so you can go to the next person."
Strive to find your own answers.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
The throughput issue was a massive turn off for office hours this
semester, and there were many times where I decided to just stick it
out on my own, researching my errors on stack overflow rather than
waiting a significant amount of time for the targeted help. While
the TAs help would have been much more helpful than random,
semi-related forum posts, it probably would have taken more time to
get it than the time I spent flailing around on the internet.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Awesome. It may feel like flailing but your learning the most valuable
skill: reading, filtering information, and learning from other
people's experience.  This is incredibly valuable for every student to
master and I'm glad you've gotten a good start.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
I'd personally prefer if this class had a github as 2041 does where
students can commit their work to a repository for TAs to review,
either online or in person as to reduce the amount of stress that it
puts on students to have their code up and ready to show.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This is a frustrating issue for staff members as well. A shocking
fraction of students, on getting TA attention, don't even have their
code editor open and ready to discuss. Or, they will talk about what
the code does and when asked demonstrate, find that their code
doesn't compile due to tinkering.  There is no easy remedy for this
but it hurts throughput as TAs must either wait for readiness or
iterate to someone else.  We are discussing ways to solve this and I
had not considered use of git/github.  That is a can of worms that
I'm uninterested in opening but I'll see what we can do.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
When there's a queue for your OH the help you provide is half-assed!
at best a theoretical solution to a small part of project Qs. not
sure what the logic behind choosing to help with one of many part
problem is but it seems that there was none put into it.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I gather you were not happy with office hours help. I'm sorry to
hear that. Some of the things you expressed discontent for are my
directives to staff on how to help: guide students to ask the right
question which should be specific and answerable, and then help them
answer it.  The results of this are that staff will usually NOT
write lines of code for you nor walk you through entire problem
solutions.  That's your job, to solve the learn to solve the
exercises yourself.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>I have nothing but praise for how much help was provided to us while
we struggled though it. It often wasn't enough for everyone to get
help in a timely manner but it was still so amazing of the TAs and
also Kauffman who spent so much time in the UOH.</li>
<li>I didn't know such intelligent TAs were a thing. Every TA I
interacted with explained everything so well. shoutout to the
section 7 lab TAs.</li>
<li>I really liked going to unified office hours, even if I didn't get
help with the problem that I was stuck on, I liked being surrounded
by people doing the same thing.</li>
<li>I thought that the united office hours were really helpful, and
having them more often would be helpful to a lot of students. There
were many times where I came a half hour before regular office hours
started, and wasn't able to even get help before they ended, so the
united OH were a nice change.</li>
<li>I really like the unified office hour. I'm a TA myself and I feel
like OH not only make a really good use of time of TAs but also help
students be more engaging in the OH.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
Unified Office Hours were Caroline Heine's idea and have worked out
smashingly from the staff's perspective. We are grateful to her for
conceiving and implementing them and we will continue Unified OH in
the future.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
I really respect the thought and effort that was put into Unified
Office Hours, but ultimately I didn't feel like they added any value
over having normal office hours. For the 2-3 times I went to a
Unified Office Hours, no matter the time I went, it was always
flooded with at least a 20-student deep queue
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Part of Unified Office Hours is to help staff manage the large office
hours. This has prominence as a 20-deep student queue is demoralizing
for a lone staff member but much less so for a group of staff
members. It also creates continuity that a student who does not get
helped at the end of a single TAs office hour is at the end of the
queue for the next one whereas they are first up in Unified Office
Hours.  While we respect and value student opinions, staff universally
liked Unified Office Hours and will continue them in future offerings
of the course.

<li><p>
I'm a commuter so I would like to have more evening hours online
because some days, I have classes all day and got home late, and
most TAs have their evening in person so I couldn't attend any of
it.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
While I appreciate the conundrum you face, this is not an online
university and this was not an online class. Most TAs indicate that
they find offering in-person help to students more effective so opt in
that direction. While we try to have some online office hours, it is
not likely we will be able to cater to folks in your situation
much. The only recourses are to stay on campus late some nights or
enroll in online courses as much as possible.

Stagger the project due dates so that some students have them

several sittings to complete the program.  This is an extremely
important experience that I want folks who come through my courses to
get. It automatically means that there will be more code to write and
the complexity of that code will be higher.  Without many such
experiences, students will simply not be mentally prepared to write
industrial applications. Projects will stay strong.

Staff also commented that Labs could use some more structure and

I wished the projects were worth more, since they require more work,
otherwise lessen the project load and keep the same weighted amount.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Projects are a lot of work. So is training for a marathon,
gymnastics event, or musical performance. Unfortunately, the
training/practice gets little attention, only the main
event. Educational design usually centers around formative
experiences (labs, HWs, projects) and evaluative assignments (exams) to
determine the level of mastery achieved.  I acknowledge that some
students experience anxiety in exams which hurts their performance
and may wish to see the project work carry greater weight.
Unfortunately, we must also content with the reliability of the
assignment scores. Projects have many supports through staff help
and also many opportunities to cheat. I just completed my analysis
of project plagiarism and found a substantial number of project
submissions with the signs of plagiarism. I expect there are quite a
few cases I am not detecting in addition to these. It is very hard
to police a student who pays someone else to provide a new solution
to project then submits it as their own. This has happened in the
past and despite my not detecting any instances of it now, I expect
it has happened this semester as well. That same student is likely
to struggle to do well on an exam due to their lack of
preparation. While exams have their own problems, in-person exams
are the best way I know to actually attribute understanding to a
single individual. If we had resources to do other forms of
examination like individual oral exams, I would explore these. Right
now though, project work has only a modest trust level and so will
likely remain at a modest portion of the grade. Its real value is in
preparing students to deliver on the exam for which most student
report they do a good job.

<li><p>
The main source of stress from this course is that its deadlines
match up almost exactly with those of CSCI 2041
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Alas, the fiefdoms that are college courses do not coordinate much
with one another. This is regrettable but also good practice for "real
life" where you are likely to have a variety of competing demands on
your time and need to plan/prioritize carefully.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
My only comment would be that the workload seems quite large
compared to other 4 credit csci courses.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The UMN has an official policy on this here:
<a href="https://policy.umn.edu/education/studentwork">https://policy.umn.edu/education/studentwork</a>. In brief, 1 credit is
equates to about 3 hours of work per week for "an average grade."
Thus a 4-credit course like CSCI 2021 would take 12 hours per week
of work for that average grade. Taking 15 credits in a semester is
42-45 hours per week to pass classes. No wonder students with full
loads and part time jobs are strapped for time. The notion of an
"average grade" is hard to pin down and the amount of time to
achieve the same results varies from student to student, but I
expect any 4-credit course where learning actually occurs take an
many hours outside of class to absorb and master the content. That's
what I'm gunning for in the courses I teach. So&#x2026; confirmed: the
workload for the course is high.

No one here (not the TA's, nor the professor) ever made you feel

Truth. But let them find their own path. The smartest kid I knew in
undergrad never went to lecture and convinced me to hand his HW in
for him at discussion sections. He still whipped me on my overall
grade.  Figure out what works for yourself and own it but don't
expect it to work for everyone else.

By that I mean how 'make' file worked, but I think that's more of a
analyzing the code and searching about it myself.

You'll likely encounter <code>make</code> and its descendants in future
