EP were amazing but having people ask questions in class just to get
ep is very distracting because some ask questions just to get ep and
they are too complicated and it gets so distracting. Already have
hard time focusing.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Like free speech, in-class questions are a mixed bag: when you
encourage folks to speak, you might not always like what they have to
say.  I found only a few instances in which students appeared to be
"farming EPs", asking questions just to earn credit.  The majority of
questions, 95% or so, are legit and inform both the student asking but
their colleagues and me as well. 
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
One thing that could be better is having more information on the
slide show, for example including the answers to the excersizes
would be helpful if reviewing just the slideshows alone.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Slightly awkward but, literally every Exercise is followed by
Answers:

</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
Personally, I wish our professor can always hold the lectures both
in-person and online via Zoom at the same time (And recording as
well). So that I can see the lectures during class time without
going to the classroom, and later on check on the recording of one
of the specific lectures for review.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Not likely to happen. I've seen others struggle with handling
in-person plus online plus recording. Try it sometime yourself and
you'll likely find that it's a lot more difficult to manage than you
think.  Catering to a few online folks when the majority is in-person
is pointless as mostly what folks want is a recording.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
Having participation points come from labs AND lecture was
confusing, since it seems like the system is rewarding multiple
different parts of class, when it would probably be simpler if it
was just one.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This is a fair quibble but the point is Engagement: if you are putting
forth regular effort by doing labs and attending lecture you are
engaged.  If you start projects late and need to submit late, you are
not as engaged as we'd like.  These two play against each other which
is why they are connected. It would be simpler to disconnect them, but
as has been said, "Make everything as simple as possible, but not
simpler." (Einstein).
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
I commute via bus to school which can take an extreme amount of
time&#x2026; The setup of this course has made things so much easier for
me. Not having to attend labs/lecture in person, posting slides and
records, discord office hours + piazza. All of that helped so
incredibly much.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
One of the lessons from the plague was that it is not too hard to set
infrastructure up to support students in varying circumstances. While
we are still an in-person institution primarily with full service to
those coming physically to campus, there are reasonable accommodations
that we try to provide based on past experience for those on the move.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
I like the engagement point policy, though I think there should be
more opportunities to earn them through means that aren't talking in
class, which some people aren't super comfortable with
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Labs and Piazza discussion are these opportunities.

On project 3, you should have more unified office hours in the week
before it is due. This was by far the most challenging project and
TA help would've made it a little smoother.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I'll take that under recommendation. However, staff time is valuable
and having multiple days of office hours like this is a huge
commitment. I would not do this without significant staff backing:
they have projects to complete too.

I felt overwhelmed by the practice tests if I didn't know as much
as I thought because I felt I didn't have enough time to study to
get up to speed.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I had not heard this perspective previously. I'm open to suggestions
on what can be done but right now I like the cycle of having a
practice exam near to an actual exam.  The schedule is already tight
so I'm not sure what to change. Ping me if you have ideas.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
I found the problems where you try to find the error in a chunk of
code to be REALLY challenging in that frame of time.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Debugging skills are crucial skills in computing. I agree that time
pressure makes them even more daunting. Nonetheless, my exam
philosophy is to examine whether students have extracted vital skills
from doing the coursework so I'm likely to continue using debugging
problems.
</p>

Its hard to recover from a bad exam

<p>
A very bad exam score does hit your standing overall.  I will
consider in the future whether some measures are worthwhile to
mitigate this. However, with overall grades in the course as high as
they are, there isn't much urgency to this from my perspective. That
may feel disappoint on an individual level for some students and I
am sorry for that. Unfortunately, my responsibility is to the
population.

It's incredibly frustrating to go to office hours near the end of a
project when you have a minor bug that needs to be fixed and someone
who has just started their project that day is asking for help
getting started on the day that its due.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I agree. It is frustrating for the staff as well that folks
procrastinate.  We have tried a variety of ways to limit
procrastination and encourage engagement. They have had varying
levels of success. I don't expect to stamp it out completely
ever. Fortunately all it takes to surmount this type of frustration
is patience so cultivate that. It solves a shockingly wide array of
problems.

I found the written description of project sufficient enough that I
did not watch the overview videos (or I did, once, but did not learn
anything new).

The bomb assignment was exceptionally frustrating
</p>

<p>
It does require a lot of patience and thought.  Hopefully you got well
acquainted with GDB in the process. If you did, the frustration will

I expected an assignment about reading assembly code to be a
nightmare, but the binary bomb turned out to be a lot more fun than
I expected.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Different strokes for different folks&#x2026;
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
The third project was extreamly hard and I felt like we didnt get
taught enough ASM and there arent that many ASM resources online as
its kinda outdated
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"It's kind of outdated&#x2026;" Heh. Reminds me of a video I saw recently
in which someone railed that "It's 2023 and have to program in this
super inconvenient, stupid assembly language."  I laughed.  It's like
saying "It's 2023 and we still have to walk using our legs instead
floating. Super inconvenient."  Assembly is not outdated. Sure, some
dialects like x86-64 are full of warts but so is everything that hangs
around for 5 decades.  Every CPU and microcontroller out there is
designed and constructed as a physical device to implement an assembly
language so it is hardly "outdated". As well, "convenience" is not
part of the picture: folks actually have to build these incredibly
complex machines just to get a little assembly language at all.  The
options are more or less "code against this assembly language
interface" or "do it by hand".  Most folks find the former more
"convenient" and the latter "outdated".  
</p>

<p>
I'm sorry that did not come through in the class, that assembly
languages underpin all that we do in applied computing (as opposed to
purely theoretical computing). We did select a textbook with TONS of
information on assembly. Have a look at it sometime&#x2026;
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
The one project I didn't like was project 3 because coding in
assembly is hard.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It is hard to code in assembly. That's why folks invented
interpreters and compilers. Once you code in assembly, you realize C
IS a high-level language.  If you ever need build a compiler or
interpreter, you're not better acquainted with how assembly works.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li>Project 1 was really tough for me, that is partly on me for starting
it late but I wished it could've been more emphasized on how time
consuming it was.</li>
<li><p>
Projects were a slap in the face for me, I'd finish one part of the
homework (e.g. stocks part of P1) and realized I should've started
way earlier if I ever dreamed of finishing the hashset part.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
TAs tried very hard to project this by holding tutorial sessions 1
week before the P1 deadline. They reported that this worked well for
students that attended.  I'm sorry that our messaging didn't reach
you. I'm told for many students, CSCI 2021 and 2041 are the first
courses in which they can't sit down and hack out a project the day of
the deadline.  For folks accustomed to that, larger projects require
adjustment that is painful sometimes.  However, real world projects
are NOT hacked out in one day so this is a necessary adjustment that
is better learned earlier rather than later.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
In this class I feel like the labs are basically copy and paste from
example code, and projects are super complex&#x2026;  I'm just not a fan
of the project system.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If you want to learn to write complex programs, practice writing
complex programs.  If you have a more specific idea of how to bridge
the gap between lab and projects, lay it on me. However, just about
every technique that was used in projects was demonstrated in a lab. I
admit that many students need to be reminded of this:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"Remember what you did in Lab 07?"</li>
<li>"No, I just copied and pasted"</li>
<li>"Well pull it up and look at it. What do you see?"</li>
<li>"Oh, it's a lot like this part of P3."</li>
<li>"Almost like someone designed it that way&#x2026;"</li>
</ul>
<p>
Thankfully we have a lovely staff there to have such reminder
conversations. 
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
I liked that the labs and hw tie directly into the project a lot in
how to do things, it was super helpful to revisit labs/hw when stuck
on the project.

Projects always taught me so much, and I'm so grateful to have
amazing TA's to help and guide me through them, but I guess I'm
really here to maybe bring awareness to those who simply don't know
how to start a lot of the time. (I will say, though, it's super
satisfying once I get to see code that I struggled to write
workcorrectlyandwell , and a lot of the time I do feel proud of
myself :D )
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
All satisfaction comes from starting, struggling and finally
arriving. Always take a moment to feel proud when you arrive.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
Additionally, I think it could have been cool if we had a bit of
freedom for some of the projects to create something on our own.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Occasionally students ask for this. In days bygone when classes were
smaller, it was more feasible to allow such freedoms. These days with
the large class sizes, it is hard to scale up to allow individual
expression.  You'll find opportunities for this in some upper level
classes so be patient.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
The projects currently were a little too easy and simple in my
opinion, but at the same time it provided so much knowledge and
experience.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Glad that they didn't break your back and proved useful.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
Some of the projects were very hard and very stressful.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Sorry that they proved so difficult for you. I hope that you found
some value in them, either now or in the long run.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
Project release times were a little unpredictable at times.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I agree. I have grand ambitions but run late on things and I'm sorry
that negatively impacted folks at times.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
I wish there was a lab or earlier lecture that went into more depth about ELF.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We tried to cover the essentials for the project but there is a lot
that goes into the format. Thankfully you can investigate this on
your own as there is a ton of information out there on the ELF
format.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
I like the idea of having extra credit for the projects but I wish
this credit could be used for the class in general and not just for
other projects.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I'll consider amending this in the future. Makeup credit on Projects
is intended to help folks patch problems they had with earlier
projects.  But I can see your reasoning here and will think about it.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
I think that one thing I would change would if at all possible
making the project pages more condensed, as there is a lot of
information present on the page, which can be daunting to start the
project. It made me rely more on the intro video rather more than I
would have liked.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If you have some suggestions on how to condense a project spec, lay it
on me. This year several TAs tried their hand at reformatting a few
project specs to make them more approachable. After working on it a
for a while, they decided that it is as short as possible without
omitting information that is useful in some contexts.  Students like
videos as they synopsize starting the project well. Students also like
tutorials and office hours because they can get a TA to explain parts
of the project. But just about everything you need to know is in the
project spec so that those other things are optional. If you are
willing to read.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
I would spend much effort to come up with a solution that is freely
provided on the project page. I'm not suggesting you change anything
here, but I would have preferred to not have the hand holding as
then the rewards of my efforts would have extended beyond my ego.

<li>Lab attendance should be worth something. I went to every single lab
and watching the TA demos was awesome and it helped me a ton, but by
the end of the semester no one was really going anymore, and it was
me and maybe five others who showed up regularly.</li>
<li><p>
Man, so many of the TAs were very helpful. I wish I could connect
any of the names I see on the canvas page to a face (so maybe add
headshots next semester so people can more easily praise their
favorite TAs), but everyone was knowledgable and patient when it
came to my questions.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Headshots are a good suggestion. I've heard from tons of students that
never learned the names of TAs and this would help.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
HW was similar to lab in terms of what we learned each week, which
was nice for the reinforcement of our knowledge.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Labs and HW are meant to be low-hanging fruit to teach course
concepts. Glad the combo worked for you.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li>I would suggest for the future would to make the homework more
important for students to not just click through, even I am guilty
of that.</li>
<li><p>
HW: very hard to motivate myself to do the code part of the homework
when the quiz gave you the answers and the code wasn't tested
</p>

<p>
Labs: The overviews were very long and unnecessary because the labs
were mostly copy and pasting code
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I am reluctant to increase the difficulty of labs and HW much as
they are meant to build skills projects which are more
challenging. However, I'll try to rework some labs to make some of
them a bit more interactive. This may as well help with the
copy-paste perception mentioned by others.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li>I really like the weekly homework and labs since they helped
practice what was taught in lecture.</li>

<li>It was annoying that lecture lagged behind the homeworks a bit, but
not too bad.</li>

<li><p>
Sometimes I felt like the labs and the homeworks didn't line up very
well with the lecture.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
There are some concepts that are better lectured on while others are
better practiced in a lab setting. Ideally I could pick a lab day
for folks to meet that aligned well with how the lecture flowed. But
unfortunately we are resource constrained. I'll continue to try to
schedule lectures in a way that compliments labs and HW but I don't
expect have covered everything in lecture before a lab/HW is
released every time.

Also, I know curving is not really a thing, but perhaps add a slight
curve to everyone's grade
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The median overall score in the class was 87%, a high B grade. 80% of
all students received an A or B of some form.  I see little need to
arbitrarily increase grades overall most students would likely reject
<a href="https://academics.hamilton.edu/biology/smiller/curve.html">  traditional grade curving</a> which assigns a flat percent of students
each letter grade.

things is the community.

I had never been exposed to C language, which made me completely
unable to keep up with the progress at the beginning of the course,
which made my first test score very low.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I'm sorry you were caught off guard by the pace of the course. No one
is expected to know C as they come in. They are expected to have
programming proficiency. It is quite difficult to keep up if you are
trying to make up for an experience deficit too.  Whether or no that
was your case, I don't know.  However, I hope you came away having
learned some things despite the difficulty.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
I didn't like learning assembly by actually programming in it. I
felt as if it was a waste of time to learn all of this just to not
use it ever again.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I'm very sorry to hear that. Saying as much means that some of the
core ideas of the course did not sink in for you.  If you'd like to
discuss this further, let me know and I'll see if I can clarify why
what you are saying is so wrong.

<li><p>
There were brief concerns about how welcoming the class is for
female students&#x2026; Kauffman's constant use of "bruh" without any
female or gender neutral counterpart used interchangeably&#x2026;
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
That's not a brief concern. That's a major concern. If you'd like to
talk more about this, please contact me.  I'd be interested to here
your ideas on equivalent terms for "bruh"; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/4j3uz1/whats_the_female_equivalent_to_bruhbro_ya_know_in/">the internet is full of
suggestions</a>.  The term "bruh" as a variety of meanings but I use it
almost universally in mocking contexts as I associate it closely with
stereotypical male behaviors like arrogance, over-confidence, and
failure to listen.  The half dozen times I used "bruh" in the lecture,
that was my intent, to be humorous about behavior I find
disappointing.  I'm sorry that this attempt fell flat. Professors are
not known for their comic sense but we won't get better without
practice and feedback. I have known lots of male students who have
demonstrated "bruh" qualities but very few folks of other genders who
have show similar behaviors.  This may be in part due to there being
more males in computing. When we reach a better balance of genders, I
suspect I'll see folks of non-male genders exhibit "bruh" tendencies
and I'll need some new terminology then. If you have ideas on how to
gently deride certain unfortunate attitudes in a gender-egalitarian
fashion, let me know.

Being unacquainted with Ben Shapiro, I took a few minutes to look
him up. He is a conservative talking head: anti-abortion, pro-gun,
anti-vaccine, homophobic, pro-Ted Cruz, all views I find repugnant.
He seems like a top-tier bruh and I expect I'd disagree with him on
most things.  If you were looking to compliment me in some fashion,
you've failed spectacularly. If you were looking to take a shot at
me and hurt my feelings, well done. If you didn't know what you were
