<li>Also, I would highly recommend making recorded lectures available to
students (if only by request) once we transition back to in-person
learning. It helped me tremendously to be able to go back and
rewatch, play at different speeds, pause, and use subtitles. I don't
think I would have been able to retain as much if I didn't have
these options.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>
Alas, FERPA rules dictate that enrollment information is
private. Since lecture recordings including student names, I will not
be able to share them with future students, only with the students
that were enrolled at the time.  However, I will endeavor to make
videos of some sort in the future as the ability to re-watch lectures
for review or make-up was highly valued.

<li>I think that the breakout rooms during lectures should be required
participation and not just for engagement points. I had another
class that required these breakout rooms and for me, it really
forced me to stay on top of things and not push off watching
lectures till later.</li>

<li>I understand the importance of breakout rooms, but for myself and
I'm sure at least several other students, I found that the
possibility of getting called on to speak in front of the class very
anxiety-inducing and definitely led to me watching more lecture
videos rather than attending live.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
My experience so far with breakout rooms is mixed. They are meant to
reflect fast in-class exercises which we would do in-person. Alas,
technical issues often interfere which is a pain.  More importantly,
my anecdotal observation is that only about 60% of groups actually put
forth effort and less than that actually engage fully to sort out the
many details that are baked into exercises. I will continue to try
breakout exercises BUT will mix in in-class discussion as well
especially when time is short.

<h3 id="org3eeadac">Office Hours</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3eeadac">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I really didn't like how long the queue's for TA office hours got
but I don't really think that there is anything that the TA's could
have done to fix this. I think its just a result of everything being
online.</li>

<li>I was able to utilize office hours much more than normal since it
was online, making getting help despite long lines much easier for
me.</li>

<li>I wouldn't mind having virtual office hours in future classes (when
they return to in person instruction). I got more 1 on 1 time with
the TAs and it helped improve my understanding better than when
office hours were in person.</li>

<li>I would wake up early around 8 or sometimes 7 to queue up when
office hours start and already see tens of people in line if not
more.</li>

<li>I think the queue system on discord worked well to approximate how
live office hours would function, and I liked discord as a tool
other than the possible learning curve that some might go through.</li>

<li>I think office hours were easier to access, but in turn that made it
much more populated.</li>

<li>I liked the slow mode on discord, as well as the limit on when
people could queue up for office hours and help.</li>

<li>Could there be some way to require that students to give better
descpriptions of their problems to use office hours, like maybe
requiring a link to a piazza post they made even if the post was
just made?</li>

<li>I kind of liked the discord office hours because I could get help at
a time that was usually good for me compared to in person where I
would have to go to a specific building for help and not know if I
had to wait a long time for it or not.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
Office Hours are generally difficult to manage and doubly so
online. The general consensus is that Discord did a reasonable job of
this though it has some failings. One of these quirks is that it opens
the possibility to "queue camp": pitch a vaguely worded question on
the help queue early in the day and then show up to office hours in a
good position.  This is not tractable for in-person help and I don't
have a good remedy yet for Discord but will be thinking about
it. Discord has many features and high scriptability which may help to
address some of these issue.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I think all csci courses should consider having an online office
hours option even after covid is gone because half the trouble with
attending office hours in the past was getting there but this saves
a lot of travel time for people who want to get help but commute to
school.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
I imagine MANY things from the online-only era will carry over into
the return to in-person.  We will keep online office hours in mind to
help at least some students.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you have 20+ students waiting in line for help every week leading
up to projects and exams, that should probably be an indicator that
the instructor is doing something wrong or insufficient.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
Every class I have every taught both here and in my previous
University has featured office hour crushes at certain times in the
semester.  I have considered whether this is a "bug" in my style and
instead account for it as a "feature" that stems from two factors.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I give reasonably challenging projects that may force students to
learn concepts or code more intensely than they have done so
previously</li>
<li>I teach large classes. With 350+ students in both sections of CSCI
2021, it would only take 10% of the class to require help on a
given project to net 35+ students at office hours.  I believe
strongly from experience that 10% of students are likely to
procrastinate and start projects late which leaves office hours
close to deadlines packed. If anyone sees a constructive remedy for
this, particularly on how to prevent students from procrastinating,
I'm all ears.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6be79a8">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Engagement Points - I like the system, but it was very hard to keep
track of my points, which meant I was eventually unsure of whether I
had enough for using them on late days for projects.</li>

<li>The engagement point system is pretty good, but I think that the
part where we can get it from answering questions on piazza or
participating in lecture is a bit blurry.</li>

<li>Engagement points are an interesting idea, but Piazza is the only
place they don't work as intended. Students will reply just for the
sake of replying, somehow managing to write so much yet so little at
the same time, just to look like they're contributing so they can
receive an engagement point.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
The Bonus Engagement Points that could be earned from Lecture and
Piazza were a manual labor of love from me which I simply did not have
time to keep up with regularly.  I'll be contemplating some other
means by which I could report these in a more timely fashion but
participation like this is always a bit tricky to track.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I think engagement points were good, but they should be given an
upper bound, like at most 3% extra credit.  It just feels a little
unsafe knowing that some people maybe could have gotten like 5% just
from answering questions online or discussion boards and
so. Otherwise, I think the engagement points give students lots of
flexibility.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
The average Engagement Point score among all students was 10.68 but
there were two students who earned 18 and 19 respectively. I knew
these two by voice as they attended nearly every lecture and
contributed a tremendous amount to discussion through excellent
Q&amp;A. While it is true that these two likely didn't need the additional
credit, I do not believe their participation interfered with anyone
else who wanted to participate during lecture and providing them with
some recognition for their work is appropriate.

<li>In future, it might be helpful (might be too much of a giveaway, but
figured I'd mention) for TA's to post brief overviews for students

often office hours queues are filled by people who start projects
super late and don't have any substantive questions other than
"AAAHHH what am i supposed to do I don't know what's going on".</li>

I believe the TAs did do this for some projects. As I recall, Project

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Please, please, please change project 1 for future students. Most
other projects were decent, but project 1 was probably the biggest
challenge during the semester which isn't fun when you're trying to
learn a new programming language and pointers during the
apocalypse. An easier, fluffier introduction to pointers would
probably help ease students into the concept and result in less hair
pulling for everyone involved.</li>

<li>I felt like the projects were so incredibly time consuming for the
limited amount of impact they have on the overall grade.</li>

<li>I found the projects to be unbearably difficult at times, but I
found these struggles necessary to succeed in the course, so I would
not recommend changing the difficulty.</li>

<li>I think the projects really solidified my understandings of
concepts, but if we didn't have a topic covered in a project I don't
really remember/understand it that well.</li>

<li>Some of the projects were taxing, but that's probably where I
learned the most so it was an effective use of time.</li>

<li>The projects really drove the material into your head.</li>

<p>
Programming is a difficult activity but the only way to learn how to
talk to the machine in a specific language is to write something
appreciable in it. I know that some students were caught off guard at
times as in addition to learning C which was a stated course goal,
their knowledge of prerequisite concepts likely data structures or
basic file I/O may not have been firm.  I appreciate the recognition
that the difficulty of projects is not spurious: it teaches quite a
bit for the effort that is applied.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When it comes to projects there was quite a large variance in
difficulty.</li>
<li>I liked that [projects] were most like a bell-curve in
difficulty, most difficult in the middle of the semester, more
lenient at the end.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Project difficult was intended to vary.  The projects were also meant
to teach or exercise different skills and students often vary in their
own skills. It is natural that students would perceive differing
levels of difficulty in the projects.

than the projects themselves. I think I spent a longer time reading
the requirements than doing the coding for some of them,</li>

<p>
I assure you that my solution to all projects is MUCH shorter than the
description of what to do.  The quickest way to convey to someone the
nature of the correct program to solve their problem is to hand them
that program. Pray that our customers never learn to do this as if
they can code their own solutions, then they likely won't need to hire
us programmers.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I never felt a need to study too much for exams in this class
because simply completing the projects did this for me.</li>

<li>I think having projects due at least three days before exams might
be helpful. This is because projects are really good ways to study
for the exam and it'll ensure that students with the bad habit of
procrastination (like me :/)</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I think it would be interesting to have at least 1 group project in
the future. I feel like it is important to have students work in
teams because in the "real world" group coding is very common and
can certainly be valuable to experience it before then. This project
could also be longer than the others and slightly more challenging
so the overall difficulty remains the same.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
Group projects are a mixed bag and my experience from allowing group
projects in CSCI 4061 has been many students prefer to work alone. I
agree that learning cooperation skills is essential but I am
unconvinced that CSCI 2021 is the right place for this to occur.  It
is a sophomore-level course which means that there will be large
disparities in skills and maturity among students enrolled.  This
creates major problems for effective group work where one must assume
most group members are equally capable of contributing, not the case
at this level. I will be looking for possible ways to incorporate more
collaboration, likely in labs.

<li>I feel having more coding assignments, especially towards beginning
of course when C is being heavily introduced would have been more
effective. I do not dislike the demos, I just felt I needed bit more
C practice before first project.</li>

<li>Having separate coding exercises that are relevant would be
cool. Maybe not graded, but easier small problems to introduce code.</li>

<li>I think the labs could be more structured like assigning people to
work on problems together in groups during lab time like how it
would be in person, but that might be a little hard to do on
discord.</li>

<li>I liked the change of labs requiring code to be completed as I felt
like I learned more that way.</li>

<li>My biggest complaint with this class is that labs go way too fast
and because of that I am just trying to keep up with the answers for
the quiz rather than really absorbing useful information. Using the
whole 50 minutes for a demo and going slower would be nice.</li>

demos, at the start of the lab, I feel it would be nice to use zoom

20 min before the end of the lab we could do the little demo all
together.</li>

<p>
I'll be considering adjustment to the lab structure for the
future. When we met in person, we would have students work together in
groups to solve worksheets which involved analysis and coding. Most
students found labs to relatively easy to solve but not particularly
rewarding unless they involved some coding.  I also want to make some
adjustments to TA involvement as the demos were only partially
successful.

that I could just try each answer on the quiz with no penalty.</li>

At the midterm, most students reported NOT doing this but I am unsure
whether this was honesty or an attempt to prevent more difficult HW

course of study.  I'm not likely to change that much unless there i

Be patient.  No one learns to ride a bicycle all at once.  You learn
by watching others ride, sitting on the bike for a bit, riding with
training wheels for a while, eventually removing them, falling on your
face a few times, and then pedaling like crazy.  A good CS curriculum
teaches you a bunch of ingredients and gives some small projects for
you to train on but it's likely that won't feel proficient until you
have worked on some real-world projects. This could happen in your
first internship or job. Most employers expect significant amounts of
training for fresh graduates. If you are in a hurry, get involved in
an open-source project like the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode">VS Code</a> or <a href="https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs">Emacs</a>.  While these might
seem bewildering at first, at least TRYING to understand the code will
