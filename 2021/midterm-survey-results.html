<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd163385">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I struggle with the labs and the quizzes which I feel often contain materials not covered in lecture.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
There is always a bit of slack/tension between lecture position versus labs/HW.  Usually HW is stuff we will discuss over the course of the week's lecture and sometimes lab leads lecture by a bit.  It's hard to get everything lined up perfectly. Hopefully lab demonstrations at the beginning of lab hit some of the high points about content that might be leading lecture.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Labs is a bit weird since sometimes the TAs explain the lab in portions, where they explain it and have us work on it, then stop to explain another part. By the time we reach the other explanations, most of the class is barely paying attention or we're too focused on the first part. I think the best way is to give the general explanation/outline at the start for all 3 questions and then give us uninterrupted work time. I really do appreciate the guidance from the TAs, it just seems weirdly structured.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
I've instructed TAs to regroup labs midway at times to ensure there is some discussion about what has happened and what's next. Sorry if that is disruptive. If there is widespread discontent, we can make adjustments.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If it's possible, could the homework solutions be uploaded after the homework is due so we can check our understanding before we move on to new topics in upcoming weeks?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
I usually try to upload HW/Lab solutions a day or two after the deadline passes. If I forget, remind me via email.

<h3 id="org4c62ef0">Project 1</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4c62ef0">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I really, really think you should ease off on these projects, at least based on the first one.</li>
<li>Project 1 for me was very difficult, so much so that I had to turn it in late. However, I learned a lot from this project. It helped me understand more about the course and helped me on the midterm exam.</li>
<li>I enjoyed doing project 1 even though it was hard. I think having the work cut out for you in comments and project documentation helps a lot.</li>
<li>The project SUCKED! Felt amazing getting all the "ok" responses though.</li>
<li>If we can have projects and tests be on different weeks it will be really great and probably result in better results overall.</li>
<li>The project difficulty was definitely a shock that I will need to adjust to, but their is some momentum now. It seems that the first project of every CSci class tends to be difficult due to the infamiliarity with the language.</li>
<li>Problem 3 felt like you wanted us to suffer why are there so many functions, and why do we have to create our own main file after already doing problems 1 and 2?</li>
<li>Project 1/the labs aren't that difficult.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
One of the most common elements of feedback was that Project 1 was difficult or at last time-consuming. Consulting the bar graphs above, 50% of students reported P1 was harder than other medium sized projects they've done. 36% indicated they spent more than 15 hours on the project.  I'd like to investigate this more, in particular to find out some of the sources of that difficulty.  Perhaps we'll get a "focus group" together to discuss.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>So far I've struggled with structuring my time and it hurt me on the project, but I think I'm learning how much time I should give myself now.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Learning time management is an incredibly valuable skill. It takes practice particularly with coding stuff but coming to understand how fast you yourself can get things done will be a great boon to your working life.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For the project&#x2026;. I think that banlet should have been one project and treemap a different project. Maybe with a week and a half for each? That would have given a bit more mental wiggle room I think.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
That's worthwhile to consider and TAs indicated some intermediate deadlines might assist students in focusing in early. I'll consider such a structure for the spring offering.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sometimes on the project it seemed like the TAs didn't know what they were doing.</li>

This is quite possible. In some cases, Kauffman have released the project in the evening and a TA who has office hours the next day has not yet had a chance to study it thoroughly.  In most cases, TAs that are not able to offer immediate assistance will do a follow-up by having students email their code for later consideration.

<li>Waiting for office hours for 4.5 hours on that tuesday before the project was due was not very fun</li>
<li>If we could have separate sign ups regarding parts of projects/labs I think it might make OH more time efficient for everyone.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>
This was a common element of feedback and many TAs are already utilizing this strategy when office hours lines are long: call out for students in the queue who are interested in discussing the details of one part of a problem. It is not a panacea: students must actually pay attention when TAs ask for folks interested in a particular problem. In addition, students are often confused and find that their problem is actually different than the one under discussion. Finally, it can feel unfair that a student who just arrived at office hours gets help quickly because a TA happens to select a "group problem" that applies while a student who has been stuck on an individual bug is left to wait. We'll continue to do our best.

I'm sorry that happened to you. It must have been extremely frustrating. If a TA is truly short to the point of rudeness, that is something I would want to hear about as it is against or policies and principles.

If you explained in turn that you already re-watched the lecture and were struggling to understand the relevance, then the TA should have helped you to understand the connection.

A few years ago we experimented with making the Project due AFTER the exam. Exam scores were marginally worse and there was still an enormous crush of students wanting help on the project due date.

Please get rid of the nope rows, or make an additional testing section, this was unbearable.</li>

<p>
This is a difficult problem. Our lecture room is far from ideal for ANY purpose but especially for exams. Sacrificing one row to allow staff to move through the room more efficiently to answer questions and enforce policies does mean some folks will be squeezed together more. However, according to my counting, allowing folks to sit in that row would have only a marginal net gain of space for a few students around the room. Mail me if you think this had severe effects on your exam performance and I <b>might</b> be able to assist in some ways. No professors I know control which rooms they are assigned for their classes. If I did, it'd be Keller 3-210 all the day long.

<p>
Yes, but I don't imagine they will be particularly satisfying. Practice. Go back to lab and HW problems you've solved before and re-work them. Spot check some C code you wrote for the project and see if you can write down and English explanation for it. Open up the Lecture code packs and go through the code. Make some changes, compile it, and use Valgrind to see what the memory errors might look like. Like anything, with repetition your ability to recognize problems and their solutions will improve but it takes time. And, alas, time is always against us.

<p>
It is very easy to feel that way and convince yourself of it. But in truth, at least a dozen students said something to this effect. When you are truly learning and pushing yourself, it is stressful. That stress is the process of you expanding and becoming bigger, stronger, and more capable than you were in the past. It can often make you question your self-worth or suitability. That's in part because any stress opens the mind up to doubt.  Embrace the doubt as normal and something that most students experience at one time or another. Learning to cope with doubts, manage them, and overcome them is a skill that is infinitely more important than two's complement integers or pointer arithmetic. You can learn this stuff. It will just take time and patience.

The week prior to the project deadline, I had about 4 students spread across my 2 office hours on Tue/Wed. I stayed from 3-6pm at the Tue Unified Office Hours to assist. By the time I left, I had asked all waiting students if they had further questions and all of them said no. I had 6 or 7 students at my Wed office hours on the project due date and helped solve all their problems between 9am-10am except for one student that arrived at 9:58am.  On the Tue after the exam, one student came to office hours and we talked for an hour about research in computer science. I don't think I need to hold more office hours. It's just that students want I and other TAs to be available to them at some specific moments that are convening to them. While I'm happy to make arrangements for meetings outside of office hours, this takes some planning ahead of time.

A treemap in Java or Python would take WAY less time to code up. That's why those languages are usually used to introduce basic coding and fundamental data structures.

While C is small as a language compared to Java and Python and OCaml, it is no more "basic" than them.

It just takes time to master the new tool. Be patient with yourself. Practice and in a year you will be much better at coding in C which will make you much better at coding in general.

There's a LOT baked just into fscanf() and if you managed to absorb all of it already, you're doing great.

<h3 id="orgc8f0381">Some Very Special Messages</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc8f0381">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>On problem 3, should I start with the main() function, or do all the functions and write my own test cases? I did the latter, but it meant that I couldn't ever check my code with the machine until the last step. But if I had done the former, I would be relying soley on the machine test cases, but those are often difficult because each test case relied on multiple functions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
It's much worse than you think. For example, how would one write a test case for <code>treemap_add()</code> that does not use <code>treemap_get()</code> or <code>treemap_print()</code>? One could attempt to directly interrogate the structs and check that certain pointers are set with appropriate key/val pairs in them, but this breaks abstraction barriers by assuming the structs will have certain field names, layout, and so forth. That means any test for <code>treemap_add()</code> will need to rely on some other function like <code>treemap_get()</code> and vice versa.  
</p>

<p>
What beginning students often miss when they learn about software testing is that at some level, there is always "coupling", groups of related functionality that must all work together cohesively. "Unit Tests" are sometimes taught as "function tests" but this is only possible in the simplest, almost trivial cases. A "Unit" is more often a group of related functions that manipulate a data structure and cannot each be tested in isolation. Testing the Unit necessitates using several coupled functions which makes it more difficult to determine which function might be "responsible" for bugs. In fact, it might be a disagreement between the two functions placing the fault on all of them and none of them.
</p>

<p>
Software testing is much trickier than it may appear at first. I'm glad that Problem 3's Treemap got you thinking about this set of difficulties as they won't go away. While my approach to the test cases balanced ease of implementation for me with reasonable rigor, it does take some practice to interpret test results and utilize them to debug. That is invaluable practice that will server you long into the future.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I personally think that the projects should be partner projects. If the TAs are essentially going to be writing the code for us anyway when we finally manage to get into OH, why not allow us, students, to figure it out together? It makes no sense to do programming individually in my opinion.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Thanks for the feedback but you seem to be harboring some ideas that I need to correct.
</p>

<p>
If any TA "writes code for you" during office hours without explanation or discourse, I would like to know about it. This is not my directive to them and in all cases I am aware of, they abide by it and instead help students to understand what code should be written. This is to support students becoming self-sufficient by the end of their studies.
</p>

<p>
If you finish your degree and are not able to write programs and solve problems on your own, "individually", then you will be in bad shape and are not likely to be able to hold down a position for long. During a job interview, evaluators are not likely to be impressed if you rely heavily on them to help you solve screening questions. On the job, it will become apparent to those around you that you require constant assistance which is likely to affect your viability at a company. Working in a team is important but it is prefaced on the ability of team members to contribute effectively. To contribute, you'll need some individual skills. Practice now to prepare to be a team member.

The processor also does not care about objects and classes. However, if you want to cater to the humans that want to code with them, you'll have to know how to talk to the processor to "make" them.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>QUICK QUESTION: How much time would you recommend spending on a problem (or a problem in a function) before asking a TA for help?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
GREAT QUESTION but it's not quick. I don't think anyone has asked it in a succinct fashion like that. Typically I'd suggest visiting a TA when you are truly out of ideas about things to try. As you get more experience, perhaps through visiting TAs, you'll be able to generate more things to try on your own and so will come to need less help. Here are some things to try before visiting a TA.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If you have a compiler error, read the error message, look at the
line or lines generating the error, search the internet for the
error message, read the posts associated with them, make changes to
your code and try recompiling, write down what you changes you have
tried in a list so that you don't repeat yourself. If you've
noodled on a compiler error for 1 hour and tried 6-10 different
variations and can't figure out, get help. Once you get help to
resolve it, <b>write down the cause and how it was resolved</b>. Even if
you don't ever look at the note again, the processing describing
problem and solution will solidify it in your mind so that you can
solve similar problems quickly going forward.</li>
<li>For memory problems in a test case including output that stops due
to a segfault, look at the lines Valgrind reports are problematic,
especially early ones that indicate problems before the line that
caused a segfault. Speculate about what could be going on, how
memory could be uninitialized or not allocated or how logic could
be causing out of bounds accesses or null pointer
dereferences. Write down what you expect be true at various points
in your code and then <b>print values in your code</b> to see if they
match your expectations. If you know how to use a debugger, set
some breakpoints and inspect things while in your code. If you've
tried that for a 1.5hours and are still not able to figure out a
memory bug, get help.</li>
<li>For output or logic problems in which expected and actual output
don't match, describe specifically out loud to yourself how the two
outputs are mismatched. Describing the problem Out loud is
important as it forces you to verbalize things which might cause
you to notice things you hadn't before.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">Talking through your bug
with a rubber duck or other inanimate listener</a> is known to assist
with this process. As with memory problems, if you expect certain
parts of your code do certain things, add print statements to it to
ensure the code is running and values are as expected. Don't
guess. Don't assume. Verify and base your study on observations:
"This part of my code should print this part of the output. I'll
add a debug printing statement before it make sure it
executes&#x2026; That's weird, it didn't print the debug statement. Why
wouldn't I be getting to this part of the code?" If you have
peppered your code with print statements for 1.5 hours and
everything checks out but the bug persists, get help.</li>
<li>If you are not sure how to get started coding up a portion of
required functionality, do some reading. Examine the problem
specification carefully. Speak it out loud. Re-explain it in your
own words. Look especially at diagrams or demonstration sessions as
these often show the end result that is desired. Write a little
"pseudocode" to describe a process you might think is applicable,
then execute your pseudcode on a small example to see if it makes
sense. This will tell you whether your understanding is solid
enough to start coding or if you need some further study. If there
references or background material mentioned like "as we did in
Lab02" that you don't remember, go back to those materials and
re-examine them. Try to construct statements like "in this case,
the code should do X then Y but if that's not true it should do Z"
and as you have doubts, form them as a question of "in case W
should the code do U or V?" which you can easily ask someone
else. At the point you have such questions, you can often search
the specification and get answers yourself but if you turn up no
answers, you have some very specific inquiries to put on Piazza or
put to a TA in office hours.  After 2 hours of studying the problem
specification, writing it in your own words, posing questions and
attempting to answer them yourself, if you are still stuck with the
same issue, then get help.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Maturity is knowing what to try and how to rule out possibilities through analysis and experiment until the truth emerges. In my experience raw intellect is nowhere near as useful in coding problems than grit, determination, and patience. You are enrolled in an education to get help to speed up your learning but learning to help yourself is the ultimate goal of this kind of education. 
</p>

<p>
One other thing that is worth noting: I personally feel that I debug things fast not because I have any particular talent for it, but rather because I have 20 years of experience looking at bugs now and 10 of those are with looking at student code bugs. If you spent 20 years of your life solving Sudoku puzzles, carving wooden sculptures, practicing dance steps, you'll be extremely good at recognizing patterns, subtleties, and solutions in those domains. There won't be many surprises just as there aren't many surprises for me in student bugs.  But that takes time. Don't be discouraged if you are having trouble with a bug: get help to overcome it but then take measures so you can overcome it yourself in the future.
