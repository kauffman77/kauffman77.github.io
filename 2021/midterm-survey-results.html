<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7812de1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Problem 3 from project 1 was brutal and creating everything from
scratch was a much more daunting task than filling in stock
functions. I wish more time was dedicated to explaining how to
approach problem 3 in the instructional video compared to problem 1
and 2.</li>
<li>I feel like the solo projects really force me to dive deep into the
material which is great i feel like i learned a ton of C and gained
a decent amount of confidence in myself&#x2026;.. but for a solo project
it is a bit long in my opinion as I am putting over 15 hours into
this one assignment to get the highest score possible.</li>
<li>I have felt confident responding to and understanding questions
during lecture and taking in the material. Applying the material has
been more of a challenge.</li>
<li>I have been having a lot of issues with the project, I am still
enjoying it.</li>
<li>Sometimes C really sucks but once the test cases pass I feel so much
joy that everything seems good again.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
Putting together even small applications is not particularly easy. But
the hard work you put into building them means you've learned how to
build things for yourself. That is something to be proud of.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I think only fixing code for the first few labs didn't give me the
hands-on experience I needed to be prepared for the project, and I
think had the labs been a bit longer or had more function coding I
would be better prepared to take the project.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
We try to keep labs small and succinct to focus on 1-2 specific
techniques. The cost of this is that one doesn't get the same level of
practice as on the project. I'll consider having slightly longer labs
to help ramp up to the project.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I know it's not related to the class but not being able to ssh using
VSCode from home has made the project 10x more tedious and
stressful. It would be nice to get an extension but I don't think
that would fix the issue</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
We've tried to provide documentation in our <a href="https://kauffman77.github.io/tutorials/unix-environment.html">Unix Environment Guide</a> on
a variety of ways that students can access UMN resources or work on
projects on their personal machines. This is because some systems
inevitably become unavailable and it is good to have backups.  I'm
sorry to hear that this has been a frustration. Consider trying some
alternatives such as a FASTX web connection or installing a local
environment on your computer that doesn't need a network connection.

<li>I hate discord&#x2026; It is a absurdly confusing platform on it's own,
let alone trying to use its A/V functions. I have never once
properly used their audio functions when I was trying to, it has
exclusively occurred when I pressed the wrong button because I do
not understand it sam-i-am. All of this to say, please please pretty
please with a cherry on top make office hours on zoom.</li>

<p>
I'm sorry to hear that you've struggled to get Discord to
cooperate. While I agree it is not the straight-forward UI that I'd
like to see, it has proven reliable and flexible for us in the past
and according to the above poll, the number of problems has been
small compared to the number of successes.  If you continue to
struggle, email me (Prof Kauffman) and we can set up a time to try to
resolve the problem.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This morning, several people were on Discord waiting for a TA who
had recently switched their office hours to be in person. The TA had
put something in Piazza about this change, but it was not reflected
on the course website.</li>
<li>In office hours a lot of times, some of the TA'S just don't show
up. So some of us students just sit there and wait for an hour and
the TA never comes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
I am aware of one miscommunication in which a TA moved office hours
in-person and posted an announcement about it but did not adjust any
other listings to indicate as much.  This created understandable
confusion and frustration which I talked to this TA about.  It should
not happen again.
</p>

<p>
If students find that a TA is not present at their office hours,
please email Prof Kauffman so that I can investigate what has
happened.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I think it's hard getting help in office hours because the times
make it hard for me to join. Since I'm either working or in class.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
You are encouraged to email to set up an appointment with any staff
member if you are struggling to get into office hours.  We'll do our
best to meet you at an alternate time so you can get some help.
</p>
</blockquote>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Also also, could you have any TAs hold weekend office hours?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
TAs select their office hours and have the option to hold weekend
times. None of them chose this out of the gate but I will pitch the
idea to them.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I wish that the office hours on Discord used a queue bot instead of
the #oh-help-queue channel.</li>
<li>Last year, 1933 had an office hours (OH) system on Discord similar
to the one this class uses now with one main difference: in addition
to regularly scheduled OH, 1933 also utilized a "ticket" system (I
believe they used the Ticket Tool bot) where people can ask
questions that TAs can answer on their own time. While similar to
Piazza, conversations often felt more fluid here, and follow-up
questions were easier to ask.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
We discussed using some fancy Discord tools but ultimately decided
that the current system of office hours, while slightly messy, is
getting the job done.  Asynchronous discussion is delegated to Piazza
which has much better visibility than Discord in the event a
conversation would benefit everyone.  We'll consider changes to this
if the office hour queue gets unmanageable but the poll results above
indicate that the office hour situation is at least tolerable.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I wish the office hours were more private, for example going to a
private room right away instead of having to explain your issue
first like that the person does not shy away or feel embarrassed to
ask more questions, etc&#x2026;</li>
<li>I think if a lot of students had a problem with the same function
for example, it would be better if the TA went through that function
explaining it and giving the needed info for those students all at
once, since this might help a number of students all at once. Then
if the students couldn't solve the problem, they could discuss it
privately with the TA</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Our current policy for in most office hours interactions is to discuss
as much as possible a student's problem in the main office hour
room. TAs have all been instructed to talk to students verbally in the
main room first, look at any test results or compilation results that
students have in the clear, and explain what they believe the problem
may be. After that phase, TAs may move the conversation into a private
room if a student's code needs to be examined.
</p>

<p>
This can feel awkward as a student must explain a problem while peers
are listening. However, it would be the same in an in-person meeting
with other students who are waiting for help. It's also bound to
happen in job interviews and actual work settings: discussing
technical problems verbally is an essential skill in computing and
now's the time to start developing that skill.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I would love it if the staff was more helpful and if there were more
office hours for students who are struggling. It would be nice to
get treated with respect and to be treated equally.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
It sounds like you had a very bad time of it in office hours. I
encourage you to email me (Prof Kauffman) to set up an appointment to
talk about it. I'd like to know more about what happened so we can set
things right.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org76406b2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I'm doing better than last semester because human interaction drives
my motivation.</li>
<li>As someone who commutes, I much prefer the online labs in past
semester.</li>
<li>I like that Prof Kauffman has friendly options for those who prefer
online options.</li>
<li>I don't really want to go to class since covid-19 and delta. I hope
we have the option to choose go to classroom or stay at home do
online class for this course later. There are too many people in the
class.</li>
<li>This maybe me personally, but I personally prefer courses online
rather than in person. I feel like with breakout room, people are
more susceptible to trade info and collaborate, where in person it
is brief.</li>
<li>I really like how most of my classes are recorded and posted on
canvas. The flexibility this gives is amazing and allows me to
consume course content when it works best for me.</li>
<li>I have a class 15 min before lecture on west bank. Sometimes I
decide it just isn't worth it and take the train home to watch the
lecture later. Seems to work well enough.</li>
<li>Being able to go to in-person lectures has been a huge help in
making me understand the course material. On zoom, I would lose
focus and wouldn't catch much of what the professor is talking
about.</li>
<li>It's quite difficult to understand what the professor is saying at
times because of wearing a mask.</li>
<li>In person is 1000% better than online in my experience, exam wise
and class wise.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
By far the widest divergence of experience comes from whether being
(mostly) back in person is better or worse than the online
experience. There is not one answer to this but thanks to all for
weighing in.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In regards to labs, if you haven't formed your initial group or
partner early on the semester, you'd most likely be working
alone. At least with online you're guaranteed a partner.</li>
<li>I think my main struggle is mostly just interacting with other
people and being able to talk to them. Most people talk to others
around me and I'm too nervous to join in on their conversations
during the times we get to talk in lectures.</li>
<li>At the very first lab meeting I though I made a friend, and about 20
minutes into us working they got up and deadass walked away mid
conversation. And tbh that kinda destroyed me so I didn't try again
during lab.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
That really sucks.  I'm sorry to hear that a number of you are
struggling to make connections in class. I did when I took this class
too, only found my crew towards the end of the semester.  I hope that
moving ahead you're able to make some connections at in-person
meetings, whether lab, lecture, or other parts of campus. Finding a
few like-minded souls with which to share the struggle makes the
college experience a lot more tolerable. Stay Determined.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For next semester, I'm not sure how much say staff have in the
matter, but please get a larger lecture room! Even if there wasn't
covid, bumping elbows with my neighbor is such a pain. It's just SO
CROWDED.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
We have near zero control over which rooms our classes are scheduled
in.  I would also prefer a larger room for the class. And that there
was no COVID. And free afternoon coffee+donuts. Se la vie&#x2026;

<li>Maybe this will change as we stray further from C into more
unfamiliar territory, but right now this class just feels like the
same stuff as previous classes with different syntax.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
As a programming language, C isn't terribly different from others:
Java and Python both have direct heritage from C. However, C is only
the lens that we'll talk about aspects of computer architecture, so
don't get too hung up on the language, which should feel too foreign,
only the parts of the machine that are exposed via using C such as
memory addresses, stack/heap, etc.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I'm finding that I'm spending more time than necessary for simple
problems that should be fixable quick.</li>
<li>Most of the time I feel like the code won't work and I don't really
know where to start in some of the problems. Eventually, I will be
able to get something down but it takes a while.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Everyone hits a point where they struggle. If you struggle long
enough, you will become proficient and your speed will increase.  That
is why it is not beneficial to judge yourself now based on how long it
takes you to solve problems. Once you've solved 100 problems 100 times
over, there are many fewer new problems that you won't recognize. This
is why experience programmers seem fast and smart: they've actually
just done all this stuff many times before. You'll be able to feel
that in time so long as you Stay Determined.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Since I've transferred from a two-year college(outside of
Minnesota), the difficulty of the course is way higher. And since I
have only a little bit of C++ experience, it is hard to understand
the materials when it comes to C code. Therefore, I feel like I am
learning a new language even though I need to work on a project and
exam. This means I feel like I am behind most of my classmates.</li>
<li>The class is going well so far. I transferred from Normandale and
was afraid I was going to be way behind everyone else, but I
actually feel okay.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Everyone comes into any course with differing previous experiences. It
takes even more to jump into a new college environment where the
expectations are different from your past school.  Don't thoughts like
"I'm behind everyone else" undermine your confidence: you belong here
if you want to be here. Your past experience may be different, but you
can still make forward progress and come away with useful knowledge
and skills if you Stay Determined.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The material doesn't cover every lab and homework and we've gotta
figure those out ourselves.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>
Yup. While I try to cover a lot in lecture, I do expect you to learn
some things on your own and have structured the course accordingly.
Turns out, the real world has the same expectation.
