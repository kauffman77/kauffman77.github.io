It is assumed you will have access to a computer with the ability to
edit, compile, and run Unix programs.  Some university labs provide
this ability; the first week of the course will cover how to set up
your personal environment as well.  If you have difficulty accessing a
suitable environment, contact the course staff.
</p>

<p>
You will need to create a CSE Labs account for use on assignments and
during Discussion. Accounts can be created here:
<a href="https://wwws.cs.umn.edu/account-management/">https://wwws.cs.umn.edu/account-management/</a>
</p>

<p>
Environments to compile and run all parallel programs will be through
the CSE Labs system so it is imperative that students set up their CSE
Labs account and know how to remotely access CSE Labs systems. Some
tactics to do so are described here:

<h4 id="orgf8dc463">How should I contact staff?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf8dc463">
<p>
Here are common situations for students and the best method to use to
contact staff.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
I want to get some real-time assistance with some coursework.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Stop by office online. Locations and times for office hours are listed
on the course Canvas site. Keep in mind that <b>office hours get busy</b>
around project deadlines so there may be a queue to wait in to get help.
</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><p>
I have a question on an assignment or course content and there
aren't any office hours coming up soon.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Post your question on <b>Piazza</b>; staff members check several times a
day and answer questions there. Make sure to post an <b>answerable
question</b> as described in the Etiquette Piazza post and <b>avoid
publicly posting large portions of your code</b>. 
</p>

<p>
You might also try <b>searching Piazza first</b> to see if someone
already asked your question and received an answer.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
I have a logistics questions such as when something is due, when
something will happen, etc.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Also use <b>Piazza</b> for most of these. If a staff member isn't sure how
to answer the question, they'll give you they're best guess sooner and
ask the Professor to confirm later.  
</p>

<p>
Staff will often use <b>Piazza for Announcements</b> such as upcoming
deadlines or canceled office hours. These announcements will go to
student email so check your UMN account regularly.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
I think some of my work was graded wrong and I want someone to look
at it again.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Gradescope</b> has a "Request Regrade" feature which will be open for
students to use after grades are posted. Using this feature will
notify whoever graded your work to have another look. If you cannot
resolve the issue, your grader will involve the professor.  There
are some exceptions to this:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Homework Quizzes allow you to retake the Quiz to improve your
score. No online Regrade Requests will be available, just retake
the quiz up to the deadline.</li>
<li>Lab Quizzes can only be regraded in Labs/Office Hours up to the
next lab. No online Regrade Requests will be available, visit your
lab or office hours to talk to a staff member about your mistakes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
I need help some one-on-one help and I can't make it to office hours
to talk to a staff about it.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Email</b> one or two of your favorite staff members to see if they can
meet outside of their normal office hours. If you don't have luck in
the first go, try contacting a different staff member including Prof
Kauffman.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
I had a major life event (got sick / family problem / mental health
problem) and I'm wondering how to cope with it and this class.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Email Prof Kauffman</b> as soon as you can. Explain the situation and
we'll work out a plan for how to proceed such as rescheduling exams,
extending deadlines, or providing some additional help
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
I'm going to miss a lecture / lab meeting. What should I do?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>No special action is required</b>: all course meetings will be
recorded and will be viewable within a day or two of them happening
to support the inevitable conflicts that arise.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
Throughout the semester, students will have opportunities to earn and
use engagement points. These are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Attending lecture and participating in discussion</li>
<li>Completing Lab Work - each lab is worth 1 EP</li>
<li>Answering discussion board questions from other students and
receiving "Good Answer" marks from course staff</li>
<li>Participating in optional activities announced during the course</li>
<li>Late Project submissions COST Engagement Points</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each Engagement Point is worth 1% to a maximum of 10% for a student's
overall grade. Each engagement point beyond this earns 0.25% Bonus
Credit to a student's overall grade. This is the sole bonus credit
mechanism in the course so students are encouraged to attend Lecture
and Lab to earn Engagement points.

<p>
Lectures will be delivered in person at the times/locations mentioned
in the course schedule.  During lectures, students will frequently be
asked to work on short exercises in Breakout Rooms with a few of their
colleagues.  After working on these exercises, the Professor will
select a 1-2 "Hot Seat" groups to discuss their answers with the
remainder of the class. Showing effort on these exercises will <b>earn
Engagement Points</b> for the group facilitating the discussion of
answers.
</p>

<p>
All lectures will be recorded and posted for asynchronous viewing
within 48 hours of the meeting.  Students not able to attend lecture
synchronously will miss the chance to ask questions and earn
Engagement Points there can still earn full credit through other means
of acquiring Engagement Points such as completing required Lab work.

<p>
Lab sections meet once per week in the locations mentioned. Credit for
Labs will be earned by submitting work online which, if completed
correctly, will earn 1 Engagement Point.
</p>

<p>
Students do not need to attend lab synchronously to earn credit but
during Lab meetings, staff will give brief demos, group students to
help complete the lab exercises, and be on hand to help students
surmount difficulties with lab work. <b>Attending lab mostly guarantees
earning credit</b> and <b>is a great place to meet other students in the
class.</b>
</p>

<p>
Lab Exercises are Open Resource and Open Collaboration. Students will
be encouraged to work in groups during lab to complete the work and
can submit their work as a group (one submission, several students
getting credit for it). Generally lab work is automatically graded so
feedback is available immediately.

an online Quiz. Completing Homework exercises will prepare students to
take the online Quiz.  Homework and Quizzes are Open Resource and Open
Collaboration: students <b>may work together</b> with other students in our

material. <b>Generally Projects are Individual Work</b> with sharing of
code or detailed solutions being a violation of the <a href="#orgfef6c3b">PRIME
DIRECTIVE</a>. Pay careful attention to the guidelines for each
programming project.  Projects are usually large and require a
significant amount of work to complete.
</p>

<p>
Project grading will include the following elements.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Manual Inspection: Projects will include a checklist of features
of completely correct answers. These usually comprise things that
cannot be easily checked automatically such as showing the process
to reach an answer, inclusion of key elements of an answer, or
style aspects of computer code.  These features will be checked by
graders and assigned credit based on level of compliance.</li>
<li>Automatic Testing: Some projects may have automatic tests provided

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-9">
<p>
There will be a series of midterm exams during the semester and a
comprehensive final exam at the end of the semester. Exams take place
during the regularly scheduled lecture period and are worth a
significant portion of the overall course grade.
</p>

<p>
At the time of this writing, Exams will take place during lecture
meetings in the normal lecture location. Any changes to this will be
posted in advance of the exams.
</p>

<p>
All exams are <b>Open Resource Exams:</b> unless otherwise specified you
may use any course content during exams including lecture slides, your
notes, the textbook, editors/compilers/shells, and any code the you
have written or received from course staff.  No communication is
allowed during the exam (no email/texting/chat), and no Internet
searches are allowed (do not "google for answers"). In addition, you
may only use exams from previous versions of 2021 if you personally
took those exams. If in doubt, ask about specifics before or during
the exam.
</p>

<p>
All exams will be preceded by official <b>Practice Exams</b> so that
students can acquaint themselves with the tools and tactics to be
successful.
</p>

<p>
Missing an exam results in a zero score and make-up exams will be
considered only in situations involving significant life events. Proof
of such circumstances will be required for a make-up to be considered.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-10">
<p>
Most coursework will be graded via <b>Gradescope</b> which features a
<b>Request Regrade Button</b> associated with specific problems and
criteria. This will notify the specific individual responsible grading
about the dispute. Raise regrade requests respectfully and
specifically: mention what you think a grader missed in your answer or
why you feel a deduction was unfair. Keep in mind that graders assign
credit based on what appears on the project and exams, not post-hoc
explanations of answers.
</p>

<p>
If a Student and Grader are not able to resolve a grading issue to the
satisfaction of both, the student can <b>ask the grader to consult the
Professor</b> who will review the dispute and resolve it. Students should
ask their grader to do this, not email the Professor directly.
</p>

<p>
When grades are published, there will generally be a <b>1 week window</b>
in which disputes are considered. Failing to request a regrade in that
time will forfeit further opportunity to contest the grade.

</ul>

<p>
<b>REMEMBER:</b> Once you give away your code/work, you lose control of
it. This may lead to pain in the following non-obvious cases
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Using a public Github repository to track your code allows anyone to
copy it and submit it as their own.</li>
<li>Sharing code with a classmate "just to help them" may lead to them
submitting it as their own, sharing it with others, or selling it
for profit</li>
<li>Giving someone access to your accounts or devices to help them may
mean that they use your account to steal your work subsequently.</li>
<li>Leaving your work open in a public space may allow someone to take
snapshots of your screen and use it as their own.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>All Of This Has Happened Before And Will Happen Again.</b> Don't
become one of your Professor's stories.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
Any instance of misconduct that is detected will be referred to the
Office of Community Standards and will likely result in failing the
course.  Be advised that the teaching team will be employing
<b>electronic means to detect plagiarism</b>.  This is extremely easy with
computer code so keep your nose clean.

<h3 id="org3e8b07f"><span class="section-number-3">3.3</span> Fair Collaboration</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
The purpose of this course is to learn about programming and learning
from one another is a great help.  To that end, the following actions
<b>will NOT be considered cheating in this course.</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Collaboration on Lab Activities and weekly Homework
Exercises/Quizzes is allowed and encouraged. These are a great
opportunity to help one another on work that counts towards your
final grade. Just make sure that you understand any solutions you
submit as per the <a href="#orgfef6c3b">PRIME DIRECTIVE</a>.</li>
<li>Discussing projects at a high level with other course students is
fair so long as no code is shared. Take great care at the point of
directly showing your work to others as your answers are
subsequently out of your own control.</li>
<li>Asking public questions on the course discussion board so long as
limited information about your own solution is included. To convey
details of your solution, use private posts.</li>
<li>Asking any course staff member questions in person or online is
acceptable and encouraged. Staff members may initiate small group
discussions in which collaboration is fine.</li>
<li>Making use of your own code or exam materials which you accumulated
from past semesters of this class is fine. If you are retaking the
course, make sure staff know this so that no misunderstandings
occur.</li>
<li>If you are unsure whether a given collaboration is fair or not, stop
the activity and clear it with your instructor.</li>
</ul>

<p>
At all times keep the <a href="#orgfef6c3b">PRIME DIRECTIVE</a> in mind when studying with other
students.  The above collaborations should be limited to getting
someone over a hurdle, not carrying them across the finish line.

There is another section of CSCI 2021 running under a different
instructor which is not coordinated with this one.  Projects,
homeworks, quizzes, lab topics, schedule, and exams will differ
between sections.  The policies within this syllabus apply only to our
section and students should refrain from collaborating outside of
their own section to avoid problems.

</p>

<p>
Students are expected to maintain a high level of civility for all
participants in and out of class meetings.  This includes respecting
participants of all genders, ethnicities, and social backgrounds.
Harassment of any type will not be tolerated and failure to behave in
a respectful manner will be reported to the University.
</p>

<p>
Observance of religious events will be accommodated for students of
any faith. All possible accommodations will be made for students with
disabilities.  Please contact the <a href="https://diversity.umn.edu/disability/">Disability Resource Center</a> and the

<h3 id="org2998982"><span class="section-number-3">4.1</span> Masking During Class Meetings</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
All students and staff will be required to wear protective masks
during class meetings. This directive comes from the University and is
intended to stop the spread of disease during the pandemic. No
eating/drinking will be allowed during class meetings so masks will
stay on everyone throughout each meeting. If students feel they merit
an exception to the policy should contact the Professor via email
before attending class.
</p>
